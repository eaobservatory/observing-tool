JAC Observing Tool via Java WebStart destructions.
--------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this you already have the code.

For the sake of completeness here are the full instructions.

1a. if in Hilo ...
git clone /jac_sw/gitroot/ot.git ot

1b. if remote to the JAC ...
git clone ssh://ssh.jach.hawaii.edu/jac_sw/gitroot/ot.git ot

2. change to the code directory ...
cd ot

3. checkout the release code ...
git checkout -b release origin/release

4. the OT is built using perl or ant ( preferred, ) build the OT ...
perl wiki-build.pl

or

ant -f ant/build.xml

5. copy the compiled code to the webstart directory ...
cp -r install/lib releaseFiles/webstart
cp -r install/tools releaseFiles/webstart

6. copy the webstart directory contents to the webserver ...
cp -r releaseFiles/webstart/* /ftp/pub/ot

7. change to the webserver directory ...
cd /ftp/pub/ot

8. run the signing script ...
perl work/isign.pl

9. test it works ...
javaws http://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/ot/jac-ot.jnlp

For future installs, step 4 is repeated, step 5 also but the files are
copied to the webserver directory. Steps 7, 8 and 9 are then repeated.
