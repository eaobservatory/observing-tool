JAC Observing Tool via Java WebStart destructions.
--------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this you already have the code.

For the sake of completeness here are the full instructions.

1a. if in Hilo ...
git clone /jac_sw/gitroot/ot.git ot

1b. if remote to the JAC ...
git clone ssh://ssh.jach.hawaii.edu/jac_sw/gitroot/ot.git ot

2. change to the code directory ...
cd ot

3. checkout the release code ...
git checkout -b release origin/release

4. the OT is no longer built using gmake, instead there are two methods
which can be used depending on circumstance. Ant ( ant.apache.org ) is
the preferred method of building, however there is also a Perl script
which can do the building. The Perl script should be phased out.

Either way, to build use one of the following ...

perl wiki-build.pl

... or ...

ant -f ant/build.xml

Building from the release branch requires Java 1.5

5. copy the compiled code to the webstart directory ...
cp -r install/lib releaseFiles/webstart
cp -r install/tools releaseFiles/webstart

6. copy the webstart directory contents to the webserver ...
cp -r releaseFiles/webstart/* /ftp/pub/ot

7. change to the webserver directory ...
cd /ftp/pub/ot

8. run the signing script ...
perl work/isign.pl

9. test it works ...
javaws http://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/ot/jac-ot.jnlp

For future installs, step 4 is repeated, step 5 also but the files are
copied to the webserver directory. Steps 7, 8 and 9 are then repeated.
