<h1>Known Bugs</h1>

<p>
The JCMT-OT currently has a number of known bugs:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
        There are various problems when running the OT with the
        OpenJDK distribution of Java.  Please use Oracle's version
        for the time being.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Many input boxes only "listen" for key-presses and don't notice
        other forms of input.  For example if you paste text into a note,
        the text may not be stored until you edit it slightly.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Some input boxes are initially displayed at too small a size to
        allow their contents to be read.  Adjusting the size of the OT
        window may cause it to lay out the boxes again.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        The target information panel can mangle offset coordinates when
        the coordinate system is changed.  Please double-check coordinates
        after changing coordinate system.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
