<h1>Introduction</h1>


<h2 id="OT">What is the JCMT OT?</h2>
<p>
The purpose of the JCMT OT is to fully specify the observations you wish
to be carried out at the telescope. As a telescope that undertakes flexible
observing .....
</p>

<p>
The JCMT OT enables users to build
a science program for heterodyne and SCUBA-2 observations.
A <a href="het_example.html#het_msblib">heterodyne template library</a>
and <a href="scuba2_example.html#start">SCUBA-2 template library</a>
are provided which allow users to create MSBs for any available observing
mode: <em>Samples, Grids, Jiggles</em> and <em>Scans</em> for heterodyne,
and <em>PONG </em>or <em>DAISY scans</em> for SCUBA-2.
</p>

<p>
It JCMT OT is quite a powerful tool; in this document we will demonstrate
how to prepare a typical observing project and point you to further sources
of information as necessary.
</p>

<p>
Regular updates to our software means that investigators are urged to
carefully inspect the examples provided in the Libraries. While the
components will look familiar to experienced JCMT observers, most have
changed, sometimes in a fairly subtle manner.

<h2 id="MSB">What is an MSB?</h2>

JCMT is a flexibly scheduled facility. But what is it that we are actually
scheduling? The quantum of scheduling is a Minimum Schedulable Block,
or MSB. An MSB consists of one or more scientifically meaningful observations
as well as any calibrations required to fully reduce the
data. <em>An MSB will always be executed at the telescope in its
entirety</em>. For more information see
<a href="faq.html#msb">What makes a good MSB?</a>
but for the moment bear in mind that the most
efficient MSB consists of a 30 minute to 70  minute observation on a single
science target and any necessary calibrations.
</p>

<p>
Now that you've seen the basics of creating an observing program,
and know what an MSB is, you will want to start creating your
own.  We've created a library of MSBs for the most commonly used
observing modes which are currently supported.  For a
description of each, and help in creating your own program,
please consult the
<a href="het_example.html">heterodyne tutorial</a>.
