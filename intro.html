<h1>Introduction</h1>


<h2 id="OT">What is the JCMT OT?</h2>
<p>
The purpose of the JCMT OT is to fully specify the observations you wish
to be carried out at the telescope during flexible observing.
</p>

<p>
The JCMT OT enables users to build
a science program for observing at the JCMT to execute both heterodyne
and SCUBA-2 observations.
A <a href="het_example.html#het_msblib">heterodyne template library</a>
and <a href="scuba2_example.html#start">SCUBA-2 template library</a>
are provided which allow users to create MSBs for any available observing
mode: <em>Samples, Grids, Jiggles, Scans</em> and <em>Rasters</em> for heterodyne,
and <em>PONG </em>or <em>DAISY scans</em> for SCUBA-2.
</p>

<p>
In this document we will demonstrate
how to prepare a typical observing project and point you to further sources
of information as necessary.
</p>

<p>
Regular updates to our software means that investigators are urged to
carefully inspect the examples provided in the Libraries. While the
components will look familiar to experienced JCMT observers, most have
changed, sometimes in a fairly subtle manner.
</p>




<h2 id="MSB">What is an MSB?</h2>

<p>
JCMT is a flexibly scheduled facility. But what is it that we are actually
scheduling? The quantum of scheduling is a Minimum Schedulable Block,
or MSB. An MSB consists of one or more scientifically meaningful observations
as well as any calibrations required to fully reduce the
data. <em>An MSB will always be executed at the telescope in its
entirety</em>. MSBs naturally vary in length but it is recommended that a
single MSB consists of a 30 minute to 70  minute observation on a single
science target and any necessary calibrations. Note: SCUBA-2 observations
should last no more than 40 minutes in length (see
<a href="scuba2_example.html#notes_40min">here</a> for a longer discussion
on this topic).
</p>

<p>
A library of MSBs for the most commonly used
observing mode which are currently supported is provided.  For a
description of each, and help in creating your own program,
please consult the following tutorials:

</ul>


<h2 id="scheduling">What happens to my project after I upload it?</h2>
<p>
During flexible observing, the observer/Telescope operator will run a tool called
JCMT-QT (Query Tool) that allows them to browse our database for
suitable project MSBs. The QT by default returns as yet unobserved MSBs ranked
by TAG priority containing targets that are actually observable, whose
site quality requirements match the current conditions, and whose projects
still have allocated time left. However, the observer / telescope operator is able to use
the QT to retrieve any submitted MSB at their discretion.
</p>

<p>
When an MSB is selected for actual execution, the Query Tool can be used
to retrieve it from our database. The observer/Telescope operator is then
presented with a list of the observations in that MSB and given the opportunity to
remove redundant calibrations from the MSB or to defer them until a suitable
calibrator becomes available. When they are satisfied that the MSB is
suitable for execution they send it off to the instrument-specific control system.
</p>

<p>
The MSB may be sent to a translator which converts it into a complete set of
instructions for the telescope, receiver(s), and backend.
</p>

<p>
The instructions are then placed in a queue that can be processed. As the queue
works its way down the list it takes any sensible course of action, such as
prompting the observer/TSS when intervention is needed.
</p>

<p>
After the observations have been carried out and deemed acceptable by the Telescope
operator, the MSB is marked as done and will not be rescheduled unless it is resubmitted
from the JCMT OT or marked un-done via the project feedback system. If repeats of
the MSB were requested (this is done by setting the <em>Observe</em> counter
accordingly), the <em>Observe</em> counter is decremented by 1.
</p>


<h2 id="deadline">What is the deadline for submissions?</h2>
<p>
There is no strict deadline for uploading programs / MSBs.
However if you don't submit MSBs for your
sources by the time they are observable you could be throwing away
opportunities of having your sources observed. Nevertheless, note
that there is no requirement that you submit your entire project
at once. Therefore you can submit some MSBs, wait for them to
get done so you can analyze the results and then submit other
MSBs to follow up on those results. Your MSBs will keep on being
scheduled until you have exceeded the total time allocated to your
project.
