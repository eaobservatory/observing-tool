<h1>Building the UKIRT OT</h1>

<p>
To build the UKIRT OT, run ant in the OT directory.
The live copy is in <tt>/jac_sw/orac3/</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
/jac_sw/orac3 $ ant
...
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 5 seconds
</pre>
</pre>

<h2>Reminders</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Builds in the live system are only done Monday&ndash;Thursday daytime
excluding holidays.
</li>
<li>
Since you will be working in a shared directory you obviously need to set
your umask to 2 first.
</li>
<li>
If the build fails you will need to fix it before you can run
any software which depends on it, such as observing normally at UKIRT
using the QT or UKIRT Translator &mdash; the OT and QT should both be tested.
</li>
