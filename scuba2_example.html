<h2 class="likesectionHead" id="info">General Information</h2>

<p>
There are two observing modes available with SCUBA-2
&mdash; a daisy for point sources and a pong for larger scale mapping.
Details on each can be at the following web page for 
<a href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/instrumentation/continuum/scuba-2/observing-modes/">SCUBA-2 observing modes</a>.
</p>

<p>
We are currently recommending a time limit on individual observations of
not more than 40 minutes in length. If you find your observations
exceed this time we suggest you increase the number of repeats (this
can be done by using the Observe counter in the MSB editor).
</p>

<p>
If after reading this guide you have any questions about preparing
your observations, please consult with your "Friend of the Project",
or email <a href="mailto:jcmtot@eaobservatory.org">jcmtot@eaobservatory.org</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="likesectionHead" id="start">Getting started</h2>

<p>
To open up the existing SCUBA-2 library go to the JCMT OT root window
and click on &ldquo;Open SCUBA-2 library&rdquo;:
</p>

<p>
<img src="s2-images/SCUBA2_library.png" alt="Contents of the scuba-2 library" width="289" height="275" class="figure" />
</p>

<p>
A window will pop up containing a list of folders. It is from this
library that we can and copy over MSBs to be used in our program.
For more information read <a href="Generic.html#lib-sc2">The SCUBA-2 Library</a>.


<h2 class="likesectionHead" id="daisy">Daisy MSBs</h2>

<p>
To access the template files go to &ldquo;Open SCUBA-2 library&rdquo;
from the small OT window.
For a template daisy MSB you will want to select,
copy and paste the <b>'Pointsource Daisy map'</b> folder.
</p>

<p>
Daisies are the simplest case and there are only 2 things you need to edit:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Your target coordinates (in the 'Target Information' component)
    </li>
    <li>
        The integration time (in the 'Scan' component). The integration time is 
        total time you want on source.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
You will have calculated the latter when preparing your proposal using the
<a href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/instrumentation/continuum/scuba-2/itc/">time integration calculator</a>.
The minimum integration time for daisies is 15 seconds although the overhead
for an observation this short will be quite high. The daisy pattern will
keep running until the integration time expires and should not be interrupted
before completion to gain the most even coverage. If you find the total time
for your observation exceeds 40 minutes, reduce your integration time and
increase the number of repeats.
</p>

<p>
The Scan Speed box is greyed out and cannot be edited. However the number
in the box is a default and does not necessarily reflect the speed for
your observation.
</p>

<h3 id=="ex_daisy">Example: Daisy</h3>

<p>
Below is an example of a 30 minute observation using the daisy mapping
strategy:
</p>

<p>

</p>


<h2 class="likesectionHead" id="pong">Pong MSBs</h2>

<p>
To access the template files go to &ldquo;Open SCUBA2 library&rdquo;
from the small OT window. You have a choice of three sizes of pongs:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>15 arcmin map</li>
    <li>30 arcmin map</li>
    <li>1 degree map</li>
</ul>

<p>
Select the pong MSB you wish to use, copy and paste the
(i.e. <b>'15 arcmin map with optional offset(s)'</b>) folder.
For pongs there are 2 thing you will need to edit:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Target coordinates (in the 'Target Information' component)
    </li>
    <li>
        Times round map (in the 'Scan' component)
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
We recommend that the number of times round the map be selected to fit
the maximum number of rotations into the 40 minute time limit.
This is the default number in the template MSBs. You may use a fewer number
of times round the map but more rotations results in a flatter map
we strongly advise you not to go below approximately 10 minutes
i.e. 3 times for a 15 arcmin map and 2 times round the map for a
30 arcmin map and 1 degree map. From the map sizes specified
the telescope translator will implement other observing parameters
(scan spacing and scan velocity) to produce an optimum map.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Pong map sizes other than the 3 standard ones can be specified,
but in those cases the observation system will use best-guesses for the pong
parameters and thus may not be optimum. Users use non-standard sizes
at their own risk.
</p>

<p>
The numbers in the greyed out boxes for Scan Speed and Sample Spacing
do not reflect the actual values used and may not be edited.
The PA also becomes irrelevant as a rotating pong will result
in a symmetrical map.
</p>

<p>
You are unlikely to want to make use of the offset iterator
for SCUBA-2 but if you do guidelines can be found
<a href="het_example.html#het_offset">here</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="ex_pong">Example: 15 arcmin pong</h3>

<p>
Below is an example of a 900" pong.
Note the height and width are adjusted to be 900" and the number of times
around the map is set to 11.

<h2 class="likesectionHead" id="notes">DR Recipe Component</h2>


<p>
When preparing your MSB's you can assign a data reduction recipe
to your observations.
The recipe you select will be applied when your data is processed
for the JCMT Science Archive at CADC. There are currently 4 main options:
<p>

<dl>
    <dt>REDUCE_SCAN</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        A basic general purpose recipe.
        If it is known in advance what type of source is being observed,
        then one of the more specific recipes below may be preferable.
        This recipe can be used for the SCUBA-2 standard calibrators
        as it will recognise them, select an appropriate configuration
        and derive a flux calibration factor.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>REDUCE_SCAN_EXTENDED_SOURCES</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        Designed to maximise the recovery of extended structure.
        This uses the 'bright_extended' config file.
        <p>
    </dd>

    <dt>REDUCE_SCAN_FAINT_POINT_SOURCES</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        Designed to extract faint emission.
        This uses the 'blank_field' config file then applies
        a matched filter to your data.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>REDUCE_SCAN_ISOLATED_SOURCE</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        Designed for observations of a single, bright isolated source.
        This uses the 'bright_compact' config file which assumes
        that there is no emission outside a 60" radius around the tracking position.
        It is not appropriate to use this recipe if there may be emission outside
        this region.
        </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The list also contains two options which should only be used for
FTS-2 observations:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>REDUCE_FTS_SCAN</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        To reduce observations of a source taken with FTS-2 scanning.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>REDUCE_FTS_ZPD</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        To reduce FTS-2 ZPD (zero path difference) calibrations.
        </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
To select the recipe you wish to use go to the DRRecipe component button
and highlight the recipe you would like to add
then click 'Set' next to the Scan button (for SCUBA-2).
</p>

<p>
For more information about the recipes, please see the
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/docs/sc21.htx/sc21.html">SCUBA-2 Data Reduction Cookbook</a>.

</p>

<h2 id="notes_40min">Integration time - 40 minute MSBs</h2>

<p>
The time limit of 40 minutes was chosen as a reasonable compromise
for an MSB between maximising the number of times around
the map in an observation and the interval between necessary constraints
such as pointing, focusing, array setups and scheduling.
It is possible to take data for longer but instrument drifts during
azimuth tracking can cause some bolometers to lose their calibration
during very long observations.
</p>

<p>
Another important factor is the amount of data the is passed to the map-maker.
We can sequence at about 45 minutes and any request for longer than this
will be split into multiple chunks.
The duration of a single chunk that can be processed by the map-maker
is constrained by the total RAM available in the computer and 40 minutes
reflects the chunk of data the map-maker can handle on a computer with
a reasonable (e.g. 60GB) amount of memory.
</p>

<p>
40 minutes is therefore a recommendation rather than a strict rule
and if your MSB exceeds that length by a few minutes you need not break it up.
</p>

<h2 id="notes_elev">Elevation constraints</h2>

<p>
It is recommend that observations are taken below an elevation of 75 degrees
for both daisy and pong maps.
The precise pattern traced by the telescope
for both of these patterns cannot be sustained at high elevations.
</p>

<h2 id="notes_cals">Frequency of calibrators</h2>

<p>
Calibration observations will be taken by the TSS every 2&ndash;3 hours.
As usual a pointing is typical done every hour or after any large slew.
</p>

<h2 class="likesectionHead" id="qus">Questions</h2>

<dl>
    <dt id="qus_ot">My version of the OT does not show the same options
    as the example?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        You are looking at an older version of JCMT OT.
        In this case you will have to insert the map sizes manually for pongs.
        You will also have to manually insert the DRRecipe component
        (this can be found under the 'component' button along
        the left hand side of the window).
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="qus_time">Why is the length of my observation slightly longer
    than my integration time?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        This is due to the dark and flat-field scans which come at the beginning
        and end of every observation.
        These are used by to calibrate the bolometers and will add approximately
        a minute to the length of your MSB.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="qus_bigger">I want to make a map bigger than a degree,
    what's the best way?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        You can build up a large area by tiling the pong maps.
        The legacy surveys have determined that the most effective way to tile pongs
        is in a hexagonal pattern.
        It is also possible to specify pong map sizes other than the 3 standard,
        but in those cases the observation system will use best-guesses for
        the pong parameters and thus may not be optimum.
        Users use non-standard sizes at their own risk.
        We recommend you don't exceed 7200'' x 7200'' for pong maps and be aware
        that the integration time does drop off considerably.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="qus_timesround">I only want to go once round my pong map, am I allowed?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        If you have a very strong source and are unconcerned about the background
        you can go only once around the pong.
        You can expect the background to be extremely variable however.
        We would recommend at least twice round and ideally not fewer than
        three times round.
        </p>
