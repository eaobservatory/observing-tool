<h2 id="JiggleChop">Jiggle-Chop observations</h2>

<h3>General description</h3>

<p>
This mode of observing is recommended for mapping &le; 2 arcmin fields
where there are emission free positions relatively close (&le; 180")
to the target.  Jiggle-Chop (JCHOP) observations utilize (i.e. 'jiggle')
the secondary to observe a regular grid-pattern of points on the sky
as well as sky positions free of emission. To reduce systematics
arising from the secondary chopping to one direction on the sky, half
the observations are done at a sky position on one side of the target,
the other half at a position on the opposite side. This <i>nodding</i>
involves moving the whole telescope, but all other offsets require
moving only the secondary mirror. This method of observing the sky
reference is also referred to as <i>beam-switched</i>.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of JCHOP observations is that the patterns can be
executed fast, with minimal telescope motions, and that the
frequent sky observations result in relatively flat baselines. JCHOP
observations are limited to targets that fit within the maximum
<i>throw</i> of the secondary mirror of 180". Both the size of the
throw and the direction can be set by the observer in the MSB for the
observation, but a customary choice is to chop in AZ i.e. at a
constant airmass. If there are no sky positions free of emission
within 180" of the target, the observer will have to select a
position-switched observing mode instead.
</p>

<h3 id="jchp_grids">Jiggle patterns:</h3>

<p>
The choice of jiggle pattern requires some care and is not
straightforward. The detectors of HARP are referred to as
<i>receptors</i> and this terminology has now been accepted for all
receivers at the JCMT. The term <i>pixels</i> is used for positions in
the output map (of course, all observations will produce a 'cube' and
the term 'map', as used here and below, refers to the spatial area
mapped by the observation). A single-receptor receiver, such as RxA,
using a 5x5 jiggle pattern will thus produce a 25-pixel map. HARP,
with its 4x4 array of receptors, using a 4x4 pattern will produce a
16x16 = 196 pixel map. Much of the complications associated with the
jiggle patterns arise from the centering of the jiggle pattern and
where the pointing target will end up in the resulting map:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
        A <b><i>receptor-centered</i></b> jiggle pattern places the
        target in the centre of the region mapped by one of the receptors and
        it will also be on one of the pixels in the output map. All <i>NxN</i>
        jiggle patterns such as 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5, are receptor-centered and
        primarily intended for use with the single-receptor receivers or
        dual-pol receivers with two receptors on the same position on the sky.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
HARP does not have a central receptor. When used with a
<i>receptor-centered</i> jiggle pattern it will align one of the inner
4 receptors with the target instead. Hence, when a <i>NxN</i> jiggle
pattern is selected with HARP the target will be far off-center in the
resulting map, or, stated differently, the map will be very assymetric
around the target position. The orientation of the map is determined
by position of the K-mirror, which can choose any of 4 angles,
differing by 90 degrees, depending on the elevation of observation. In
short, only a region of 1.5x1.5 arcmin will be mapped predictably.
Combining observations from different elevations may result in a windmill
pattern around that region:
</p>

<p>
<img src="het_images/windmill_small.png" width="284" height="262" class="figure" />
</p>

<p>
The four special patterns intended for use with HARP that fully
sample the footprint of the array are <i>harp4</i> and <i>harp5</i>,
coming in two variations each. The receptors in HARP are spaced 30"
apart and these patterns fill the 30"x30" post-stamp of each receptor
with '4 by 4' or '5 by 5' points, spaced 7.5" or 6"
respectively. Compared to a Nyquist sampling of the nominal beam at
345 GHz, the harp4 patterns slightly under-sample, whereas the harp5
patterns over-sample. Harp4 is the recommended pattern for general map
making and the cube resulting from the 4x4 receptors of HARP will have
16x16 pixels in e.g. RA, Dec and cover a region of 2x2 arcmins. The
harp5 pattern will have 20x20 pixels in RA, Dec covering the same
region.
</p>

<p>
Harp4 and Harp5 can be <i>pixel-centered</i> or <i>map-centered</i>. 
To understand the distinction one needs to realize that the spatial
dimensions of a HARP cube will always have an even number of pixels
i.e. won't have a central pixel. This presents two choices of where
to put the target in the final map:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
        A <b><i>pixel-centered</i></b> jiggle pattern will place the
        target on one of the central 4 pixels of the output map, slightly
        offset by half a pixel in each direction from the center of the
        map. As is the case for the <i>receptor-centered</i> map, discussed
        above, the map will thus be asymmetric around the target but only by
        one <em>map pixel</em>. Due to the possible orientations of the
        K-mirror the edge of the map will this be uncertain by 7.5" or 6",
        respectively. The <i>pixel-centered</i> harp jiggle patterns are named
        <i>harp4</i> and <i>harp5</i> in the JCMTOT.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        A <b><i>map-centered</i></b> jiggle pattern will place the target
        exactly in the center of the output map, precisely <i>between the
        central 4 pixels</i>. The resulting map will be symmetric around the
        target position and independent of the K-mirror orientation. However,
        none of the map pixels will align <em>exactly</em> with the target
        position, which should not be an issue for an extended source, but
        might be a concern for a source with a point-like core. The
        <i>map-centered</i> harp jiggle patterns are named <i>harp4_mc</i> and
        <i>harp5_mc</i>. Map-centered patterns are also referred to as
        <i>array-centered</i> since the target is placed on the center of the array
        between the 4 receptors.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
The four harp patterns are illustrated below (click on each pattern to
show them in a pop-up window). The cyan dots in each pattern
are the jiggle positions and the centers of the pixels in the output
map.  In each figure the pointing target is indicated by the small
circle and either aligns with a pixel or the center of the map. (For
completeness: A <i>receptor-centered</i> pattern will select a
configuation in which the blue cross coincides with a map pixel, but
with the target circle on one of blue crosses instead of close to the
center.)

</p>

<h3 id="jchp_control">Loop control</h3>

<p>
There are three parameters that control the execution of the JCHOP
observation: the <i>step_time</i>, the <i>max_time_between_chops</i>,
and the <i>max_time_between_nods</i>. The step_time is the dwell time
per jiggle position and has a minimum of 0.1s. The
max_time_between_chops is the maximum time that can be spend observing
jiggle positions before a chop to the sky reference is required,
currently set to 9s. The max_time_between_nods, current default 30s,
determines how many jiggle-patterns and sky references can be observed
before the telescope nods to the alternate chop configuration with the
reference on the other side of the target.
</p>

<p>
The dwell time per jiggle position is calculated to be as long as
possible to allow the whole pattern to be completed within the
max_time_between_chops, but not to exceed 2s per point. For a 16-pt
jiggle this means about 0.56s/point and for a 25-pt jiggle 0.36s/point.
Note: while the time between chops of 9s is shorter than the 30s
typically used with position-switching, it is much longer than what is
required for an accurate determination of continuum emission. For this
observers can select <i>continuum mode</i> in the their MSB which
changes the max_time_between_chops to 0.1s and forces a sky reference
for every jiggle position: the observing mode changes to chop-jiggle
(chop-before-jiggle) instead of a jiggle-chop
(jiggle-before-chop). However, the frequent chops significantly
increase the overheads: limited testing so far suggests that the
typical penalty for using continuum mode is an increase of the
observing time by a factor of <i>1.7</i><font color=red>CHECK!</font>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Step_time</i>, <i>max_time_between_chops</i>, and
<i>max_time_between_nods</i> have been set to defaults that can not be
changed by observers directly. Since their optimal settings may depend
on e.g. the weather, opacity, and seeing, they are however under the
control of the operators, although this is not yet being actively used
at present. PIs of science programs that would significantly benefit
from settings different from the defaults should contact their
assigned support scientist.
</p>

<h3 id="jchp_shared">Shared vs. Separate <i>offs</i></h3>

<p>
An important concept for JCHOP observations is one generally referred
to as <i>shared offs</i> (meaning <i>shared sky references</i>). This
concept originates from traditional scan-map observations where the
telescope scans across an extended source before going to a sky
reference. By necessity all positions observed along the scan will
share the same sky reference (<i>off</i>). Since 50% of the noise
observed in a spectrum (i.e. <i>on-off</i>) results from the
<i>off</i> this would lead to severe 'striping' of successive rows
unless the integration time in the <i>off</i> position is sufficiently
increased to drop its noise significantly below the noise of the
<i>on</i> measurements. Calculations show that the integration time in
the <i>off</i> needs to be multiplied with <i>sqrt(np)</i>, where
<i>np</i> is the number of <i>on</i> positions in the row. Of course,
there is nothing special about scan-maps: the same applies for any
observations where a number of points share the sky reference, as is
the case for HARP jiggle-maps where the full 4x4 or 5x5 jiggle pattern
is observed before going to the <i>off</i>.
</p>

<p>
Observations benefit from <i>shared offs</i> in two ways and the more
so the more points between the <i>offs</i> (the larger the
scan-map). To illustrate, consider 1s observations of 16 positions
(which would be a very small scan map). <i>Separate offs</i> would
require <b>32s</b> on the sky equally split between <i>ons</i> and
<i>offs</i>. Using <i>shared offs</i> the observation needs only
16+4=<b>20s</b>. But also <b>for each point individually the noise is
reduced</b> because of the longer observation of the
<i>off</i>. Expressed in a time required to reach a particular rms the
combined effect makes <i>shared off</i> observations <em>4 times</em>
faster than separate observations in the limit of many points. More
precisely, the factor is ~4/(1+2/sqrt(np)) or ~2.7 for the relatively
small HARP jiggle patterns and ignoring fixed overheads (which reduce
the factor to closer to ~2). Nevertheless, one night instead of two
nights is a huge gain, which is why <i>shared offs</i> are the default
for JCHOP observations.
</p>

<p>
Of course, <em>the above gain comes at a price</em>: all 16 or 25
jiggle-positions from every receptor are correlated because they have
the same sky reference (<i>off</i>). As long as the pixels are kept
separate this is not an issue because noise remains dominated by the
<i>on</i> measurement and the points can be regarded to be only weakly
correlated. However, any operation in which pixels are combined will
'suffer' from this correlation in the sense that it will combine
pixels that are not fully independent and the noise will hence not
drop with the customary sqrt(np) factor. Note that this both applies
to operations that use a <b><i>spatial convolution (smoothing)</i></b>
as well as <b><i>total flux measurements</i></b> that sum or average
over pixels such as <i>aperture photometry</i>. In the extreme, when
averaging data over the whole footprint of a harp4 observation, the
noise will be 1/4th (16 independent receptors) instead of 1/16th (196
pixels) of the noise per pixel.  Finally: note that JCHOP <i>continuum
mode</i> observations always will have <i>separate offs</i> because
there will be only a single jiggle position per sky reference.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion: <b>if imaging or velocity/frequency data are the
primary aim of the observations, <i>shared offs</i> are hugely
beneficial and recommended; if accurate flux measurements over
extended regions are the primary aim or the final maps will be
spatially smoothed significantly, <i>separate offs</i> are
recommended instead.</b>
</p>

<h3 id="jchp_duration">Duration</h3>

<p>
The figure below illustrates the duration of observations based on the
UT timestamps in the headers. The duration scales linearly with the
requested integration time for single-point beam-switched observations
(black dots and line). JCHOP maps with <i>separate offs</i> (red
dots) follow the same relation which is not surprising since the
motion of the secondary is not a dominating factor. JCHOP maps with
<i>shared offs</i> also scale linearly with the requested integration
time (blue dots and blue line), but require significantly less time
than their separate counterpart and, as expected, this effect scales
non-linearly with the number of points in the jiggle (cyan points
-- 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 pattern, respectively -- and blue line). The durations
in the plot include an additional ~60secs before the start UT is
written or closing the files after the end UT timestamp. The
approximate relations thus become (np: number of points in jiggle;
t_on: requested 'on'-only integration time per jiggle-point):
</p>

<p>

<h3 id="jchp_rms">Noise:</h3>

<p>
The figure below shows the noise in Jiggle-Chop observations. The top
panel compares the observed noise to the expected noise, for chopped
observations ranging from single-position to 5x5 jiggles, both using
<i>shared</i> and <i>separate offs</i>. Overall the agreement is
excellent, but the data indicate an excess noise of about 4% (the
black line).
</p>

<p>
The expected noise can thus be calculated using:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
    rms = 1.04 * Tsys*1.23/sqrt(df*t_on) * sqrt(1+1/sqrt(np))

    1.04: 4% excess noise, presently unexplained
    1.23: Correlator digitization factor
    df:   channel-spacing in Hz
    t_on: 'on'-only integration time in sec
    np:   1 for separate offs else the number of point
          sharing an off. For patterns not exceeding 9x9
          this is the number of points in the jiggle pattern.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The bottom panel shows the normalized noise: rms*sqrt(int. time) as a
function of the duration of the observations with the noise calculated
using the equation above indicated by the black crosses. As expected
the normalized noise is independent of the duration and type of the
observations, indicating no unexplained sysystematic effects, with one
significant exception: all observations with <i>shared</i> offs have
about 20% less noise than their <i>separate</i>
counterparts. Together with the previous figure above, this panel
illustrates the point made when discussing <i>separate offs</i>:
not only do observations with <i>shared</i> offs take less time for
the same amount of integration time, the resulting noise is lower as
well.

<h2 id="JigglePSSW">Jiggle-Position Switch observations</h2>

<h3>General description</h3>

<p>
<em>(Since Jiggle-position switch observations share many
characteristics with the Jiggle-chops, please make sure to have read
the previous section).</em>
</p>

<p>
This mode is recommended for mapping &le; 2 arcmin fields where an
emission free position is relatively far away from the
target. Jiggle-PSSW (JPSSW) observations utilize the secondary to
observe a regular grid-pattern of points but, contrary to JCHOP, use a
position-switch of the whole telescope to observe sky positions free
of emission.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of JPSSW over JCHOP is that sky reference positions are
not restricted to a distance within 180" from the target and can be as
far as degrees away. The main disadvantages are the less accurate sky
subtraction due to the larger switch and the longer time between sky
references.  Another disadvantage is the additional overhead resulting
from moving the whole telescope to the reference position.  The
position can be specified as either a relative position or a fixed
position.  The switch will be to this single position only rather than
two positions on diametrically opposite sides of the target, as is the
case for JCHOP. (However, note that the reference position can be
defined in a coordinate system other than RA, Dec resulting in it
rotating from observation to observation in that frame). In order to
minimize the number of moves, the telescope executes an
OFF-ONs-ONs-OFF etc. pattern, with the switches pairs-wise associated.
</p>

<h3 id="jpsw_grids">Jiggle patterns</h3>

<em>See Jiggle-Chop</em>

<h3 id="jpsw_control">Loop control</h3>

<p>
There are two parameters that control the execution of the JPSSW
observation: the <i>step_time</i>, the <i>max_time_between_refs</i>.
As for JCHOP, the step_time is the dwell time per jiggle position and
has a minimum of 0.1s.  The max_time_between_refs is the maximum time
that can be spend observing jiggle positions before a position switch
to the sky reference is require; its current default is 30s. Note
that in order to minimize the overhead of the position switch, the
rate of going to the sky position is less than for JCHOP which can
result in worse baselines.
</p>

<p>
The dwell time per jiggle position is calculated such that it is as
long as possible to allow the pattern to be completed within the
max_time_between_refs, but not to exceed 2s per point. As for JCHOP
there is a <i>continuum mode</i> which changes the max_time_between_refs
to 5s at the cost of more overhead. Note that position-switch
observations are not well suited for measuring the continuum level,
both because of their typically larger switch, as well as the relatively
long time between sky references even in continuum mode.
</p>

<h3 id="jpsw_shared">Shared vs. Separate <i>offs</i></h3>

<h3 id="jpsw_duration">Duration</h3>

<p>
The figure below illustrates the duration of observations based on the

requested integration time for single-point position-switched
observations (black squares and line). JPSSW maps with <i>separate

surprising since the motion of the secondary is not a dominating
factor. JPSSW maps with <i>shared offs</i> also scale linearly with
the requested integration time (blue circles and blue line), but
require significantly less time than their <i>separate</i>
counterparts. Contrary to JCHOP observations, and for reasons not
obvious, the same linear relation fits patterns of different size
(cyan circles -- 4x4, 5x5 pattern, respectively -- and blue
line). The durations in the plot include an additional ~60secs before
the start UT is written or closing the files after the end UT
timestamp. The approximate relations thus become (np: number of points
in jiggle; t_on: requested 'on'-only integration time per
jiggle-point):

<h2 id="GridPSSW">Grid Position-Switch</h2>

<h3 id="gpsw_general">General description</h3>

<p>
This mode of observing is recommended for sparse mapping or irregular
patterns. Grid-PSSW (GPSSW) observations don't use motions of the
secondary mirror, but instead move the telescope between the target
grid-positions as well as sky positions free of emission. Likewise, it
is possible to do Grid-BMSW observations, but these will not be
further discussed here.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of Grid-PSSW observations is that the target positions
are under full control of the observer and that under-sampled maps or
non-regular patterns can be observed. Like JPSSW, the sky reference
can be far away from the target. A disadvantage is that moving the
telescope to execute the grid is relatively slow resulting in a larger
overhead than with jiggle observations. In order to minimize the
number of moves, the telescope executes an OFF-ONs-ONs-OFF
etc. pattern, with the switches pairs-wise associated. The off-switch
will be to a single, specified, reference position. (However, note
that the reference position can be defined in a coordinate system
other than RA, Dec resulting in it rotating from observation to
observation in that frame).
</p>

<p>
[Note: it is possible to do a grid of jiggle-maps by putting a
"Jiggle-Eye" inside an "Offset" iterator. However, in this
case the jiggles will be executed as fully independent observations at
each grid point, resulting in independent cubes.]

<h3 id="gpsw_grids">Grid patterns</h3>

<p>
Grid patterns can be set up using the <i>Offset</i> iterator in the
JCMTOT, either as a regular pattern or as a list of individual
offsets.
</p>

<h3 id="gpsw_control">Loop control</h3>

<p>
There are two parameters that control the execution of the GPSSW
observation: the <i>step_time_grid_pssw</i>, the
<i>max_time_between_refs</i>. As for the other modes the step_time is
the <b><i>minimum</i></b> dwell time per point, but for GPSSW it's
default value is 1.0s rather than the 0.1s for jiggles. The
max_time_between_refs, default 30s, is the maximum time that can be
spend observing grid positions before a position switch to the sky
reference is require. The rate of going to the sky position is less
than for the equivalent JCHOP observation, which can result in 
worse baselines.
</p>

<p>
Similar to JPSSW, there is <i>continuum mode</i> for GPSSW, which
changes the max_time_between_refs to 5s at the cost of more
overhead. Note that position-switch observations are not well suited
for measuring the continuum level both, because of their typically
larger switch, as well as the relatively long time between sky
references even in continuum mode.
</p>

<h3 id="gpsw_shared">Shared vs. Separate <i>offs</i></h3>

<p>
<i>Shared</i> and <i>separate</i> modes are available as for JCHOP
(see description there), but without being able to do a fast jiggle to
cover the pattern the distinction is rather irrelevant in
practice. With a minimum of 1s/point and a maximum of 30s between
refs, multiple grid-points can only be observed for short integration
times. This means that relatively many telescope moves are required
for little integration time implying large overheads. Being more
efficient, <i>shared offs</i> mitigate the effects of the increased
overheads. On the other hand, short observations with <i>separate
offs</i> are particularly inefficient: because of restrictions imposed
by the data handling within the correlator these observations
<em>have</em> to switch to the reference after each grid-point, even
if the integration time per point is only as short as 1s.
</p>

<p>
Finally, as soon as the integration time per grid-point becomes such
that only a single grid-point can be observed before having to go the
sky reference (i.e. 15sec by default) there will be only one point per
reference and the distinction between <i>separate</i> and <i>shared
offs</i> disappears: the observations will use separate offs.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion: for any observations with integration times &ge;15s
per grid-point the choice of <i>shared</i> or <i>separate offs</i> is
irrelevant. For shorter integration times a choice for <i>separate offs</i>
comes with a heavy penalty in the form of excessive overheads.
</p>

<h3 id="gpsw_duration">Duration</h3>

<p>
The above conclusion is illustrated in the plot below, which shows the
duration of observations based on the UT timestamps in the
headers. The duration scales linearly with the requested integration
time for single-point position-switched observations (black squares and line).
GPSSW maps with <i>shared offs</i> also scale linearly with the
requested integration time (blue squares and blue line), but require a
bit more time than their 1x1 counterpart due to the telescope motions
within the grid. Although the overheads increase for larger maps with
more points (cyan points -- 4x4, 5x5 pattern, respectively --) the
increase is not very large. On the other hand, short maps with
<i>separate offs</i> (red squares and line) incur an excessive
overhead due to the many switches to the sky reference up to the point
the integration time per grid-point exceeds 15s when the distinction
between <i>separate</i> and <i>shared offs</i> vanishes. The
durations in the plot include an additional ~60secs before the start
UT is written or closing the files after the end UT timestamp. The
approximate relations thus become (np: number of points in jiggle;
t_on: requested 'on'-only integration time per jiggle-point):

<h3 id="gpsw_rms">Noise</h3>

<p>
The figure below shows the noise in Jiggle-PSSW observations. The top
panel compares the observed noise to the expected noise, for PSSW
observations ranging from single-position to 5x5 grids, both using
<i>shared</i> and<i>separate offs</i>. As for JCHOP the data indicate
an excess noise of about 4% (the black line). The bottom panel shows
the normalized noise: rms*sqrt(int. time) as a function of the
duration of the observations with the expected noise indicated by the
black crosses. The equation used is the same as given in the
discussion of JCHOP observations, but 'np' is a bit less straightforward:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
    rms = 1.04 * Tsys*1.23/sqrt(df*t_on) * sqrt(1+1/sqrt(np))

     np:  number of points with <i>shared offs</i> or 1 if none:
          max(1,int(30/t_on)) i.e. the number of t_ons that fit
          in 30sec, but no less than 1. (30secs = time_between_refs.)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Observations with <i>shared offs</i> but <i>on</i> integration times
in excess of 15s are excuted the same as observations with
<i>separate offs</i>.

<h2 id="FSW">Frequency-Switch</h2>

<h3 id="fsw_general">General description</h3>

<p>
Frequency switching mode is suitable for sources with narrow lines (~&lt;
10 MHz) and low line density. In such sources it has superior noise
performance for single point observations or small maps. Frequency
switching also has advantages in large maps when there is no nearby
line free region to use as a reference position.
</p>

<h3 id="fsw_baseline">Baselines</h3>

<p>
Baselines are common with frequency switching. There are several
reasons for this.  The frequency change and the associated variation
in LO power changes the mixer impedance, coupling and conversion
efficiency creating baselines. For small frequency switches the
baselines are well behaved and can be removed by baselining. Another
cause is standing waves in the optics in front of the mixer. These
will move in the band pass when the frequency shifts and are not
cancelled. The standing wave between the cabin and secondary has a
frequency of ~ 16.2 MHz at the JCMT. Frequency switching by 16.2 or
32.4 MHz reduces such standing waves. Thus frequency switching is most
suitable for observations of narrow lines not affected by
baselines. It should definitely not be used for continuum
observations. The JCMT uses an elaborate calibration scheme to reduce
the baselines which doubles the time integrating on calibration loads.
</p>

<h3 id="fsw_switch">Frequency switch amount</h3>

<p>
The baselines and the performance of the LO system limits
the amount of the frequency shift. Currently switches up to 32.4 MHz
have been tested with good results for both RxA and HARP. Since the
line is present in both the signal and reference observation it will
occur twice in the raw spectrum. After processing to average the two
independent lines in the spectra there will be three features. This is
not a problem for an isolated line but care has to be taken if there
is more than one line in the band pass. Users should also be aware
that lines from the earth's atmosphere not are
canceled. Terrestrial Ozone lines are routinely observed using
frequency switching. Thus CO and Ozone can generate additional
features in the spectra. The user needs to select center frequency (or
velocity) and switch amount to avoid line blends.
</p>

<h3 id="fsw_noise">Noise performance and map size</h3>

<p>
Due to the fact the same line is observed both in the source and
reference spectra the noise is improved by sqrt(2) after
processing. However, observing modes that uses one reference
observations (offs) for several on sources positions as jiggles and
grids (with shared offs) and scan pssw becomes more efficient when
the number of on source positions are large.  Neglecting overheads
these methods are more efficient than frequency switching if more than
5 on source points share the same off. The actual trade of point
depends on overheads. Thus, in cases where there not is a good
reference position in the vicinity of the source, frequency switch can
maintain the advantages for larger maps. However, it is still
recommended that the calibration is performed on a line free reference
position. This requires that a reference position is defined in the OT
target component. In cases with weak lines (line &lt;&lt; Tsys) and no
continuum it is possible to calibrate on source.
</p>


<h2 id="comparing">Comparing Observing modes</h2>

<p>
The figure below shows the duration all observing modes discussed above and
separates into three groups:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
        Most efficient: Jiggles with <i>shared</i> offs, either
        beam-switched (JCHOP) or position-switched (JPSSW). Compared to GPSSW
        or separate jiggles, these observations take 30% less time.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Single-position, GPSSW, and JCHOP/JPSSW with <i>separate offs</i>:
        these observations don't get the benefit from the shared offs or
        accrue additional overheads due to e.g. a position switch to the sky
        reference.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        GPSSW observations with <i>separate offs</i> and
        integrations time &lt; 15s per grid point: these have excessive
        overheads due to increased number of position switches to the sky
        reference.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="het_images/all_time.png" width="512" height="512" class="figure" />
</p>

<p>
In addition to taking less time, JCHOP and JPSSW with <i>shared
offs</i> will have a systematically lower noise as well. This is shown
in the next two, side-by-side figures. The figure on the right zooms
on the lower-left region of the figure top-left. Using the equations
above we find that compared to t_on_nonsh = 30s, <i>shared off</i>
observations with 16 points will need t_on_sh = 18.75s to reach the
same rms. Using the equations for duration of JCHOP observations at
the top which include the fixed overheads, one then finds that the
<i>shared offs</i> JCHOPS will take about half the time as the
<i>separate offs</i> JCHOPS: 15min instead of 33min as is illustrated
in the final figure.
</p>

    <img src="het_images/all_rms2.png" width="367" height="357">
</p>

<p>
The figure below shows the benefits in terms of the duration of the
HARP4 jiggle observation, including realistic overheads, needed to
reach a certain rms (assumed Tsys = 250 K and frequency channels of 1
MHz). Note that <i>shared/separate offs</i> are only relevant within a
single observation, which typically takes 10-20 minutes: the noise in
coadds of successive observations will scale as usual with the sqrt(nr
of observations).
