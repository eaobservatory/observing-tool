# Name:
#    drrecipe.cfg
#
# Purpose:
#    ORAC-DR data-reduction recipes configuration file for ORAC-OT.
# 
# Description:
#    This lists the available and defaulted recipes grouped by instrument.  
#
#    The default recipes are those which appear by default when a new
#    drrecipe component is put into an observation.
#
#    The default group membership sets the group membership flags correctly
#    for most ORAC-DR recipes.
#
# Notes:
#    -  Blank lines are allowed anywhere and ignored.
#    -  Comment lines (starting with "#") are ignored except that they
#    delimit blocks (as outlined above).
#    -  Remember that there must be a comment line between each item you set.
