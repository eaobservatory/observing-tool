+++ February 2005

  [Semester 05A release]
  
  - Support added for WFCAM instrument.  This includes not only the WFCAM instrument
    but also the MicroStep iterator, WFCAM calibration "eye", WFCAM library and WFCAM 
    DR-Recipe component.

  - The Survey Container has been added.  This allows you to put multiple targets in
    the same container, and gives the Telescope Operator the choice if selecting n of
    the m targets.  It can either be placed at the top level of a Science Program
    (like an MSB), in which case it can contain at most 1 MSB (acting as a repeat
    iterator for the MSB), or within an MSB, when it can contain any number of 
    observations (acting as a target iterator).

  - The target component now allows you to create "named" sky targets.  These can be either
    specified as absolute positions or offsets from the base.  The "old style" use of skies
    is still supported.

  - The sky "eye" interface has changed to support "named" sky targets.  If a named sky is
    not specified, this eye behaves exactly as it did previously.  If a named sky is
    specified, then several additional options exist:
      - You may select which named sky to use;
      - If the sky target is specified in absolute terms, then it will always go to this
        position, regardless of the base
      - If the sky target is specified as an offset from the base, the following additional
        features are available:
          - "No offset" - always go to the offset position relative to the BASE target
          - "Follow offset" - if the BASE is inside an offset iterator, the sky position
            used will follow the BASE offset pattern, with a user defined scale factor.
          - "Random offset" - the actual offset position will be somewhere in the specifed
            box centered on the sky target offset position.

  - MSB's marked as REMOVED can now be UNREMOVED and their count is maintained.

  - Better explanations of the meanings of cloud and moon are given in the
    Site Quality component, and an additional constraint of J band sky brightness is available.

  - The 150 lpmm disperser has been removed from CGS4

  - The chop settings tab on the target component has been disabled.

  - Additional validation checks are performed, including against an XML schema.

  - More than 1 observer note can now be specified, but they may not appear inside
    a sequence iterator.

  - Fixed a bug in prompting user to save.

  - Offset positions are now also shown around the Guide star (in blue) in the 
    position editor.  This allows users to see if the guider will lose lock when
    going around an offset pattern.

+++ December 2003

  [Semester 04A release]

  - Time estimates now report both total time and time without calibrations
    (estimated time)

  - Validation is now performed against the TOML schema over the web (Note:
    Failure of validation does not indicate that submission will fail)

  - Improved layout on various components - now requires at least Java version
    1.4.1

  - On start-up, we now check to ensure that the correct version of Java is
    being used

  - On submission and retrieval to/from the database, pressing 'enter' after
    the password now behaves the same as pressing the "Commit" button.

  - Corrected problem with the display of offset positions in the Position
    Editor.
