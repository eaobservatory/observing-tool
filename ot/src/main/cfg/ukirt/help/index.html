This document describes the preparation of UKIRT observations under the
UKIRT
Observing Tool. It assumes that you have already acquired
the software (see the <a href="download.html">download page</a>). Of
course if you are
using a JAC, UKIRT or JCMT machine, the software is already installed.
Email <a href="mailto:ukirtot@jach.hawaii.edu">ukirtot@jach.hawaii.edu</a>
with questions or problems.&nbsp;
<p> This guide is intended to be relatively complete without going
into the details of the science libraries on which most observing
is based. Those details can be found elsewhere (in the libraries
themselves
and on the <a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/instruments/">instrument
web pages</a>
(http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/instruments/). The
topics covered apply equally whether you are preparing observations
remotely
or at the Observatory. We suggest you read through sequentially,
following
the "tours" as they come up. <br>

Introduction</font></h1>
The central system in UKIRT Observing is a database of observations,
held at the &nbsp;summit of Mauna Kea. Observations are prepared
by the Principal Contact for each observing programme, using the
Observing Tool. The science program is stored on disk locally
(which can be anywhere in the world), and once complete, submitted into
the summit database. &nbsp;The observer at the summit &nbsp;uses
a database query tool to sort and extract observations to be done;
details of execution are instrument-specific and we do not discuss them
here. Once you are familiar with the information here, please consult
the <a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/instruments/">instrument
pages</a> on the UKIRT home page for information specific to the
instrument
required by your program. You will also need to get a password for your
database
area, from the <a href="http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/issuepwd.pl">Password
Server</a>. Your program id is something like <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">u/yys/n</span> where "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">yys</span>" identifies the semester (e.g.
07B) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span> is the id number of
your telescope time proposal.<br>
<br>
Note for queue-scheduled PIs (PATT): once your programme is saved into
the database and the semester is under way, the local file version
should be considered a backup only. This is because the repeat count on
MSBs within the programme in the database will change as observations
are done. If you resubmit the file copy into the database you will
overwrite that status information and it is possible that an
already-executed MSB will be re-done inadvertently. So the
recommendations are: (i) use a local file copy only for backup
purposes. (ii)&nbsp; if you want to make changes to your project once
the semester is under way, fetch it from the database, make your
changes, and resubmit. And (iii) preferably do so when it is not night
time in Hawaii. If you see a message referring to "file has changed on
disk" when using database...submit, it probably means that the summit
observers are active on your project and a count has changed since you
fetched the project from the database. In these circumstances it is
probably wise not to submit the changes for reasons already stated. <br>

<div align="left"> While it is possible to build up observing sequences
from

many "library sequences" found in the <b>UKIRT template libraries</b>,
which are found on the main <b>file</b> menu. As an example, the UIST
template library window is shown below, with all the libraries in their
initial non-expanded state. Click on the image for a short tour of the

<br>
<br>
<div align="left"> Typically, setting up your UKIRT program involves
opening the appropriate library, finding within it a sequence which
matches your requirements, and copy/pasting or drag/dropping
it into your new science program; then you are in a position to alter
instrument configurations, target lists and to document the program for
the observer's benefit. Refer back to the <a
 href="Science_Program_Window_basics.html"> Science program window tour</a>
for the locations of the cut, copy and paste buttons (or look at the
figure
above, where you'll see three buttons starting with the scissors). An
example
of a more complete science program is given below, but first we'll
introduce
some of the essential building blocks.<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
<br>
<h2 align="left"><a name="Minimum_Schedulable_Blocks"></a>Minimum
Schedulable
Blocks</h2>
<div align="left"> The basic quantum of observing, both in classical
and flexible scheduling (though more natural to think of in flexing),
is the "minimum schedulable block". This is the smallest part of the
program which is complete, fully-reducible and thus stands alone. <em>In
most cases, an MSB will&nbsp; be executed at the telescope
in its entirety</em>. For example, a target observation would be
incomplete
without suitable calibrations, and so one might define the smallest
spectroscopic
MSB as comprising the spectrum of a target, combined with sufficient
flats,
arcs and a standard star to be fully reducible. For efficiency, the
observing system at the summit allows the observer to skip calibrations
if not required
(e.g. if executing a number of similar MSBs which can share an existing
calibration). Note that the UKIRT template library contains MSBs, not
just
Observations, so you will naturally be building up from these.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div align="left"> You should aim to produce a science program
consisting
of suitably-titled MSBs. The title will appear in the query tool when
observing at the telescope, so try to make your titles
as descriptive as possible.<br>

<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
<h2><a name="Science_program_elements"></a>Science program elements</h2>
<p align="left">MSBs within your science program specify observing
conditions,
instrument configurations, telescope offset sequences and data
reduction recipes for all the observations you have been given time to
carry out. They do this through combinations of the following elements:<br>

<h2 align="left"><a name="Inheritance"></a>Inheritance</h2>
<div align="left"> The observing tool allows MSBs to inherit properties
from the program environment they find themselves in. For example,
if a site quality component is present at the top of a science program
(as in the example above), then none of the MSBs within the program
need to have a site-quality component of their own; they inherit it
from this global one. Conversely, a site-quality component within an
MSB "trumps" such a global component. This also applies to Target
components;
a target given at the top of an MSB, outside the scope of Flat,
Standard
and Object Observations, will apply to all three (so when the flat/arc
observation
is run, the telescope will slew to your science target). <b><u>This
may
or may not be what you intend; check the logic carefully (obviously in
this example you would also want to override the global target in the
standard-star
Observation).</u></b><br>

<h2><a name="Large_Programmes"></a>Large Programmes</h2>
If your observing programme involves observations of a large number of
targets, you have two options. Either (i) clone a template MSB using a
text-file target list, or (ii) use survey containers to hold multiple
pointings in a single MSB or MSBs. Each of these options is described
below. For large surveys of contiguous areas of sky, you should use the
Survey definition tool (SDT) which is linked to at the top of this
document. <br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Generating_a_Program_from_a_Catalogue_on"></a>Cloning a
Program
from a Single MSB and a Catalogue in a Text File</h3>
If you have many sources which you wish to observe in a similar way and
do not wish to go through the rigmarole of creating a target component
for each one, there is a way to generate a science program from a
template MSB and a text (ASCII) catalog file. This uses a web service
at
the JAC
site - so you need an internet connection to do this.
<p> Start with a science program which contains a template MSB with a
blank
target component (for example, a template MSB you have retrieved from
the UFTI library). Your catalog file should be of the format: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>PKS0106         01 08 38.771 + 01 35 00.32 RJ<br>3C84            03 19 48.160 + 41 30 42.10 RJ<br>3C120           04 33 11.096 + 05 21 15.62 RJ<br>PKS0438         04 40 17.180 - 43 33 08.60 RJ</pre>
</blockquote>
The catalog format is not blank space sensitive - if you have existing
catalogues compatible with the JCMT's sourceplot package, they&nbsp;
will
work as is, provided they do not contain planets or objects with
orbital elements.
<p> Under the edit menu (in the Science Program window), there is an
option
called "Replicate from catalog". Choose this action and you will be
asked for the location of the catalog file. Once you have done this,
the OT will contact our site and after a short delay will pop up a new
science program window containing multiple MSBs. So if you had an MSB
with
one blank target component and a catalog file with 12 sources, you will
get back a science program with 12 MSBs, whose target components have
been filled in using the information from your catalog.</p>
<p> Of course you should tweak the MSBs further, such as giving them
more
informative titles, adding guide stars and tweaking the observation
parameters on each
source.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Survey_Containers"></a>Survey Containers</h3>
Survey Containers allow you to include multiple pointings at the top
level of an MSB, such that the Observation within the container will be
done at each pointing in the container. These are generally recommended
for doing a group of pointings which lie in the same part of the sky -
e.g. four pointings to generate a complete WFCAM "tile". The containers
are present in the WFCAM template library "Survey" templates:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 346px; height: 132px;" alt=""
 src="survey_container_1.png"><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
When an MSB like the above is fetched from the database at the summit,
it is expanded into N Observations, where N is the number of targets in
the Container. However the meaning of MSB remains the same: the whole
of the MSB must be doable for it to come up in the queue. Corollary: it
is a Bad Idea to include targets over a wide range of RA in one survey
container.<br>
<br>
Here is what you see when you click on the Container itself:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 569px; height: 548px;" alt=""
 src="survey_container_2.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
To manually add and remove positions, use "Add" and "Remove" buttons at
the bottom of the panel. Here is a completed container:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 548px; height: 587px;" alt=""
 src="survey_container_4.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
Note the "Target Information" Tab. Each target has its own target info,
in a format identical to the familiar Target Component:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 568px; height: 546px;" alt=""
 src="survey_container_3.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Survey Targets</span> tab,
there is a "load" button. This allows you, if you're not using the SDT
to populate your Container, to upload a set of targets from a text file
in the following format (slightly different from the format for MSB
cloning):<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<pre>SURVEYID = Test<br>BASE BGPS3097&nbsp; 18:34:12.03&nbsp; -08:22:57.3 FK5<br>GUIDE GD2&nbsp; 18:31:12.06&nbsp; -07:59:05.2 FK5<br>BASE BGPS3100&nbsp; 18:34:19.16&nbsp; -08:23:27.9 FK5<br>GUIDE GD2&nbsp; 18:31:12.06&nbsp; -07:59:05.2 FK5</pre>
<pre>:</pre>
<pre>etc.</pre>
</div>
<pre>&nbsp;<br></pre>
The first line is the Survey ID, which will become the title of the
survey container. This is prefixed to every supplied target name as
follows:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 593px; height: 88px;" alt="" src="survey_container_5.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
(so it is best to keep it short!).<br>
<br>
Finally, note that there is a template MSB in the WFCAM template
library which uses a Survey Container to carry out a complete "tile"
(four WFCAM pointings). In this case, the diffferent pointings are
generated by using the "Offset" fields in the individual target tabs;
so the same base position should be entered into each tab if you use
this MSB.<br>

<h2><a name="IMPORTANT_-_Program_Documentation"></a>IMPORTANT - Program
Documentation</h2>
<div align="left"> There are two levels at which you <i>must</i>
document
your program's MSBs. These are (i) notes which the observer will see
and
(ii) internal notes which the support scientist will make use of when
vetting the program. The second type of note should be scattered
through
the program, identifying for your own benefit (and that of your support
astronomer)
why you have made particular selections of (e.g.) offset parameters or
library
sequence. <br>
<br>
The first type of note is what you get by selecting "Show to the
Observer"
in the Note component. We do not expect (or allow) summit observers to
access your program in the OT to find out what you're trying to do;
instead, your MSBs, individually, can each contain one note (flagged as
"show to Observer") which will pop up on the QT screen at the summit.
These notes should clearly contain rather generic information about
the program as a whole, plus any specific items for this particular
MSB; the following table gives examples of the two types of information.<br>

<br>
When you click "show to observer" you are presented with four boxes in
which
we require you to place indications of your positional accuracy,
description
of your source's infrared appearance, brightness estimates (visual and
infrared)
and signal-to-noise requirements. This documentation has been a
requirement since Semester 03B; the aim is to ensure that
Observer
notes are of more uniform quality and detail - the above four items
were
considered particularly important for summit observers to know. Filling
these

<h2><a name="Observer_notes_-_what_NOT_to_do"></a>Observer notes - what
NOT to do</h2>
Here we list some common faults with observer notes. Please avoid these
if you can.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Instructions which aren't necessary</span><br>
Please <span style="font-style: italic;">don't</span> confuse the
observer by apparently issuing instructions in the observer notes which
are in fact implicit in what the MSB will do. For example: "Please
offset to nearby sky field for sky flats" is superfluous if that's what
the Observations in the MSB actually do. Instead, try something like
"The MSB will first offset the telescope to a nearby sky field and take
a sky flat jitter."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Concatenate incoherently</span><br>
If you include "show to observer" notes in the global position at the
top of the project and also within MSBs, they will be concatenated and
the observer will, when fetching a given MSB, see both the global one
and the MSB-specific one. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with
this but please make sure that the notes (i) are at least consistent
with each other (ii) don't duplicate information (iii) are coherent
when concatenated.<br>

<h2><a name="A_Typical_Programme_Setup_Sequence"></a>CHECKLIST - What
to
look out for in a Typical Program</h2>
<div align="left">Within a typical MSB, you should be attempting to
ensure
that:<br>
</div>
<ol>
  <li><u><font color="#ff0000"><b>The MSB's contents</b></font></u>
represent a complete, calibratable observation of a science target.
In most cases this means that all MSBs must contain Observations of
a Standard Star, though these observations can be flagged as Optional
(as described previously) to allow the observer to skip them if they
are sure that a suitable standard already exists. Note that time
observing standards from <i>your</i> MSBs is charged to <i>your</i>
program, so it
makes sense to use this flag !</li>
  <li><font color="#ff0000"><u><b>The MSB is well-documented.</b></u></font>
This means that you have used both informative notes within the details
of
the Observations, plus "Show to Observer" notes which will give the
observer
a summary of what you expect. The JAC will arrange a web page with some
typical data in your observing mode, but you should be as clear as
possible in the notes which pop up for observers what your expectations
are and whatever issues you foresee. &nbsp;Your support astronomer will
vet your program
as it enters the database, and will veto your observations if they are
insufficiently well-documented.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><u><font color="#ff0000"><b>Instrument components</b></font></u>
are
consistent<u> </u>from observation to observation within the MSB (this
is usually, though not always, the intention). Note that for most
instruments,
the instrument component is global to the MSB (see "Inheritance") and
so does not need to be copied into each Observation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li><u><font color="#ff0000"><b>flats and arcs</b></font></u>, if
present, have all had their settings set to the default<u> </u>for the
instrument configuration chosen (beware of making a small change, for
example altering a slit width, and finding that your flats are
overexposed).</li>
  <li><font color="#ff0000"><b><u>darks,</u></b></font> if present,
have
had their settings set to the detault for the instrument configuration
chosen.
For example, a change in the estimated magnitude of an imaging standard
can change the exposure time and this must be reflected in the dark.<br>
  </li>
  <li><font color="#ff0000"><b><u>target list components</u> </b></font>have
been set up, with guide stars in the case of faint objects<br>
  </li>
</ol>
The best way to do this is to set up one MSB, adhering to the
guidelines
above, and use the validation button to check it. This will pick up
common faults like dark exposures being inconsistent. If you're still
uncertain, your support scientist is available to help with queries.
Then (depending on the details of your program) you may be able to just
copy/paste
the MSB and edit target and instrument components to generate the rest.<br>

<h2><a name="Estimates_of_Execution_Time"></a>Estimates of Execution
Time</h2>
<br>
Your program builds up its total estimated elapsed time in stages.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><img alt="*" src="observe_icon.png" height="17" width="23">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Observes
can be set to a number of repeats; generally this is one for
UKIRT instruments such as Michelle and UIST.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><img alt="*" src="iterator_icon.png" height="20" width="20">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Repeat
iterators specify the number of times the Observes within
them are carried out.&nbsp;
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><img alt="*" src="observation_icon.png" height="19" width="19">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Observations
show you the estimated time of the sequence they contain. <br>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><img alt="*" src="msb_icon.png" height="19" width="18">&nbsp;&nbsp;
MSBs give
you the estimated time of the Observations they contain
- in this case the science observation plus any calibrations
observation.
To be clear: this is the estimated time of that single MSB.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><img alt="*" src="scienceprogram_icon.png" height="20" width="21">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Science
Programs give you the estimated time of all MSBs they contain,
including the number of repeats. So if you have a 1hr MSB and you
set the MSB counter to 2, your MSB estimated time will be 1hr and your
Science Program time will show 2hrs. </li>
</ul>
<br>
NOTE: while these estimates are quite accurate (to within 10%) in most
cases,
there are circumstances in which they can fail to represent the time
taken
to execute your MSBs. Example include programmes with large offsets
(the
crosshead takes a finite length of time to reach its guide star). It is
not
possible to take every such vagary into account in the time estimation.
In
the example quoted, the overhead of a sky nod could be brought down to
roughly
zero by ensuring that the guide star could not be reached in the sky
position,
but the OT cannot be expected to know what guide stars can be reached
and
which cannot. You should check your programme's quoted timing for
obvious
anomalies and contact your support astronomer if you find any.
Experience
shows that accessing your flexed data early and looking at elapsed and
on-source
times can show up efficiency faults at the 5-10% level. Since this can
cost
you an MSB or two at the end of your programme, you should make every
effort
to make such comparisons as early as possible in the semester, once
data
start to appear.<br>

<h2><a name="Saving_and_Submitting_your_Program"></a>Saving and
Submitting

<div align="left"> On completion of the program (and in general it's
also wise to do this as you go along), click&nbsp; <b>file...save</b>
in the program window, and save the program to a local xml file (name
it <b>&lt;whatever&gt;.xml</b> ; note that if you want the .xml suffix
then you have to type it). From this version on, the system will
automatically
save a <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;whatever.xml.BAK&gt;</span>
backup
file which is the program as it was at the time of the last successful
save.
<br>
<br>
To store to the summit database, click <b>database...store </b>on the
program window and enter your project password, which you can obtain
from the <a href="http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/issuepwd.pl">UKIRT
password server</a>. Once in the database, your support scientist will
vet the program, using a <a
 href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/observing/MSB_vetting.html">checklist</a>
which covers the issues above. <br>

<br>
<div align="left">
<div align="left"> Here we outline some facilities which are either
more advanced
than a typical program is likely to require, or more than the beginner
user might expect to use.<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="AND_and_OR_logic"></a>AND and OR logic</h2>
<div align="left"> Most programs will be catered for by simply creating
a
set of MSBs and at most specifying their relative priorities and
perhaps
some scheduling information. However, more complex programs can be
built up using the logic provided by "AND" and "OR" folders. The basic
function of these folders is as follows:<br>
</div>
<br>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="5" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffff99" valign="top"><br>
&nbsp;<img alt="" src="folder_or.png" height="47" width="96"> <br>
      <br>
      </td>
      <td valign="middle">Allows you to select one or more (default is
one) MSBs from a list. If the default is used, then once an MSB from
the folder has been done, the rest are marked as unavailable.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffff99" valign="top"><br>
&nbsp;<img alt="" src="folder_and.png" height="50" width="96"> <br>
      <br>
      </td>
      <td valign="middle">Allows you to simply group MSBs together. In
general, ANDs make most sense when contained within an OR folder,
allowing
you to have two completely separate programs (potentially with many
MSBs each), only one of which gets done. For example, you may have a
set of
targets in two separate star-forming regions, don't need data in both
but
do need one region to be completed. ANDs inside an OR is the way to do
this.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
An example of the use of these folders:<br>
<br>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="5" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffcc" valign="middle"><img alt=""
 src="and_or_program.png" height="347" width="385"> <br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">Here, for the sake of illustration, a PI has
managed to convince the TAG that there is merit in granting time to two
rather different projects under the same banner. The resulting science
program contains two OR folders. These do not interact with one
another; completing the first OR doesn't mean that the second OR (which
is at
the same indent level) does not get done. All being well, the PI will
obtain data on both sub-projects; the details of what they get is
catered
for by the AND and OR logic.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ff0000">Within the (simpler) second OR folder</font>,
the PI has asked for two out of three MSBs to be done. Depending on the
timing, these could be Oph-elias 29 and Oph-BK44, or some other pair
from the three. The important point is that once two are done, the
third
is marked as unavailable. Selection of the number to do is done in the
OR folder's window.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ff0000">Within the first OR folder</font>, the PI
has
required only one of three things to happen: either (i) the single MSB
on NGC4594 knot 3, or (ii) one of the two programs on knots in NGC4565
or
NGC4321. So the minute an MSB from the NGC4565 program is done, both
the
NGC4594 single MSB and the NGC4321 program is marked as invalid.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<b><br>
Formally:</b> <br>
<br>
ANDs were designed specifically to go inside ORs (to allow you to group
MSBs)
but are also available to group MSBs in general (to allow them to share
instrument
configs etc).<br>

<h2><a name="Usage_through_a_firewall"></a>Usage through a firewall</h2>
If your Institution connects to the internet via a firewall, you may
find
that connections to catalogue servers etc. fail. If this is the case,
then
you can specify your proxy server and port number on the OT preferences
window
(accessed via the File menu). For a networked installation, you can
edit
the file ot.cfg and supply the server and port on the lines supplied
towards
the end of that file.<br>

<h2><a name="Aside:_Specifying_Spectroscopic_Standard"></a>Specifying
Spectroscopic
Standard Stars</h2>
If your programme is spectroscopic, &nbsp;and you wish to specify
standard
stars yourself rather than leaving the choice to the summit observer,
we
suggest the following rules as a way to guarantee a reasonable airmass
match
to your target observations:
<ol>
  <li>Determine an RA appropriate for the mid-point of your
observations
by <i>subtracting</i> <i>half</i> the target observation time from
your target RA.&nbsp; e.g. If your target has RA of 12 34 56 and your
total observation time on target is 40 minutes, then your standard
should have RA ~ 12h 15m. </li>
  <li>Look for a standard with the RA calculated as above and a similar
Declination
to your target, using either the <a
 href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/astronomy/">UKIRT
Standard
star lists</a>, the Standard star library in the OT, or the <a
 href="http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/nir/specstandards/telluricsearch.html">Gemini
Standard star finder</a>. Try to get as close as possible but at least
within
about 10 minutes in time for the RA and 10 degrees for the
Declination.&nbsp;
F stars are preferable to G or A as A have strong hydrogen lines and G
may have molecular bands.&nbsp; A types are preferable to G if there
are no
suitable F stars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Notes_on_guide_stars_and_acquisition"></a>Guide
stars
and acquisition scenarios</h2>
<div align="left">
<div align="left"> Your guide star may be chosen from plate material
which
is many years old, and even if more recent it may have surprisingly
poor positional accuracy (Guide Star Catalogue sources for instance can
have systematic errors of up to two arcseconds depending on their
location). In these cases, the details of how you centre on your source
and guide
star can be important depending on your mode of observing,
slit width etc. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guide-star brightness
(Cassegrain)</span><br>
Off-axis, UKIRT can guide down to 18th magnitude (moon and cloud
dependent). the UKIRT guide camera operates effectively in the R band.
Rule
of thumb: if your guide star clearly illuminates 9 pixels in the
position-editor DSS image with default cut levels, then it will
probably be guidable (this is clearly colour-dependent so this cannot
be guaranteed). If your guide star has a hint of diffraction spikes in
the DSS image then it is about 14th magnitude and will be easiy
guidable - it will also appear in the Guide Star Catalogue (in the
Position editor: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Catalog...Catalogs</span>,
followed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Catalog...Browse</span>).
<br>
<br>
Note that for reasons of thermal hygiene, we currently use a gold
reflective patch in the centre of the field of view; this is larger
than the UIST detector FOV and vignettes approximately 2.5 magnitudes
of guide star signal. So if you need to use a guide star close to the
science field, please ensure that it is brighter than (say) 15.5
magnitudes in the R band.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guide-star brightness (WFCAM)</span><br>
WFCAM's guider functions well down to 16th magnitude but much below
that requires unhealthily low guide frequencies and image quality
suffers. We suggest sticking to R magnitudes (again, the guide camera
works in an approximation to the R band) of 16th or brighter.<br>
</div>
<br>
<u>CGS4</u><br>
<div align="left"> We have a set of recommended methods; CGS4-specific
details
are given <a
 href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/instruments/cgs4/optical/peakup.html">
here,</a> and a more general flowchart for acquisition modes is given
<a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/%7Eadamson/Telescope">here</a> (the
latter
two links are available only through the online version of this page,
referred
to at the top of the document). You should identify in an observation
Note
which of the scenarios identified in the flowchart applies. <br>
</div>
<br>
<div align="left"> For example, if you are observing with CGS4, and
neither your guide star nor your target have accurate positions,
but the relative offset between them is accurate, then you should
identify <a
 href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/%7Eadamson/Telescope/S15.txt"><b><font
 color="#ff0000">"S15"</font></b></a> as the acquisition scenario (in
all
cases you should assume that the aperture position is known or has been
recently determined). <br>
</div>
<br>
<u>UIST</u><br>
<div align="left"> For UIST, acquisition is via the imaging mode and
peakup
is not in general necessary. </div>
<br>
<u>General</u> </div>
<div align="left">To help centring guide stars, the <font
 color="#ff0000"><b>pick object</b></font> option under <font
 color="#ff0000"><b>Catalogs</b></font> in the position editor is
useful compared
to positioning the cursor over the star and clicking. In general, stars
selected
this way come up relatively well centered and require little adjustment
of
the crosshead or telescope. This speeds observing still further and is
particularly
helpful for blind pointing to objects with good coordinates.<br>
</div>
<br>
<u>IRPOL</u><br>
<div align="left"> Polarimetry users should also be aware that the
waveplate
holder blocks much of the available field of view for off-axis guide
stars, as described in the <a

<h2><a name="Updates_in_05A_version"></a>Updates in 05A version</h2>
The 05A version of the OT was released at the beginning of February,
and caters specifically for WFCAM proposals. All other 05A projects can
continue to use the 04A OT unless they wish to take advantage of new
(non-WFCAM) features. <br>
<br>
NOTE - these updates will migrate to the main document or to the
relevant instrument page over time. Headers will be left here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WFCAM-specific updates</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>WFCAM components have been added.&nbsp; This includes a WFCAM
instrument component, and WFCAM calibration eye, microstep iterators
and DR recipe components.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Survey container added. This allows you to specify multiple
targets in a single container.&nbsp; This component also allows you to
elect to only observe some number from the list of targets.&nbsp; While
it is primarily for use with the Survey Definition Tool, it can also be
used on its own. It can either be placed at the top level of a science
program&nbsp; similar to an MSB), in which case it can contain at most
1 MSB (acting as an MSB iterator); or it can be placed inside an MSB
and can contain any number of observations (acting as a target
iterator).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The target component now allows you to create "named
skies".&nbsp; That is,&nbsp; at the bottom of the target component
where you used to be able to select "GUIDE", you can now also add "SKY"
and/or "SKY_GUIDE".&nbsp; The sky position can input as either an
absolute value, or as an offset from the&nbsp; base.&nbsp; If you don't
want to use it, don't - in which case you can treat sky "eyes" just as
you used to.&nbsp; However, using them does allow some additional
functionality (described below).&nbsp; Each sky position specified will
be called SKYn, where n is an integer starting at 0. Similarly there is
a SKY_GUIDE which will allow you to guide on a patch of sky.&nbsp;
Again, this is primarily useful for survey work. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The sky "eye" has changed to support the named skys.&nbsp; If you
don't specify a named sky in the target, this will have exactly the
same behaviour as the old sky eye, though it will look different.&nbsp;
If you do specify a named sky, the GUI allows you to select which sky
you want to observe.&nbsp; Depending on how you defined the sky, its
behaviour is somewhat different.&nbsp; If you specify an absolute sky
position, you will always go to that position.&nbsp; If you specify it
as an offset, then the three checkboxes on the user interface come into
play.&nbsp; These give you the following options:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">a) No offset - you will always go to
the offset position relative to the BASE target<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">b) Follow offset - if your target is
inside an offset iterator, the sky position be offset relative to the
BASE offset, scaled by a user defined amount.&nbsp; So for example if
you had an offset iterator with two component (0.0, 0.0) and (0.0,
20.0) and your sky had an offset of (0.0, 60.0), then the sky positions
observed would be at (0.0, 60.0) and (0.0, 80.0) with a scaling factor
of 1.0, or ( 0.0, 60.0) and (0.0, 70.0) for a scaling factor of 0.5)<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px;">c) Random offset -
the sky offset will be at some random position centered on the defined
sky offset relative to the BASE, and with a box defined by box size.<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">General updates</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>MSB's marked as REMOVED can now be UNREMOVED and their count is
maintained.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>On the site quality component, a better explanation of the cloud
and moon constraints is given, and a new constraint, J-Band sky
brightness, is added.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The 150 l/mm disperser has been removed from CGS4</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The chop settings tab on the target component has been disabled.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Validation now uses an XML schema.&nbsp; There may be some
side-effects of this change which we have yet to uncover, and user
feedback will be appreciated. Since this is a web service any changes
will not require a new OT release.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>More than 1 observer note can now be specified (but they can not
be put inside a sequence). At the summit, these notes are concatenated.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Offset positions are now displayed around the position of the
guide star as well as around the target. This helps when deciding
whether a guide star will fall into an inaccessible area&nbsp; Guide
star offsets are displayed in blue. Highlight the offset iterator to
display these offsets.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><a name="Updates_in_04A_version"></a>Updates in 04A version</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Time estimates now report both total time and time without
calibrations (estimated time)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Improved schema validation for both telescopes. Validation is now
performed against the TOML schema over the web (Note:<br>
Failure of validation does not indicate that submission will fail).
Note that to validate against the most recent criteria requires you to
have a working network connection.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improved layout on various components - now requires at least
Java version 1.4.1</li>
  <li>On start-up, we now check to ensure that the correct version of
Java is being used</li>
  <li>On submission and retrieval to/from the database, pressing
'enter' after the password now behaves the same as pressing the
"Commit" button.<br>
  </li>

      <br>
Occasionally fails to pick up
the correct position when plotting a target. This results in a "base
position is out of view" message on the position editor screen and
either a blank field or an image from cache. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Work
around:</span><br>
      <br>
This can be worked around
by closing the position editor, switching to another target component
and back again, and relaunching the editor. <br>
