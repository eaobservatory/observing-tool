# Name:
#    ircam3.cfg
#
# Purpose:
#    IRCAM3 configuration data file for ORAC-OT.
# 
# Description:
#    This file is organised into a series of information "blocks".  One
#    "block" provides information on a single item, though this information
#    may be complex.  A block may not have comments within it; it is in
#    fact delimited by the comment character.  For practical purposes this
#    means that you should comment each information block, as this will
#    also delimit them.  Section "Blocks" describes the options for an
#    information block.
#
# Blocks:
#    Blocks are one of the following:
#    -  keyword with a single value, e.g. DEFAULT_DISPERSER = "150lpmm";
#    -  keyword with a vector of values, e.g.
#    INSTRUMENT_APER = {6.35, 11.77, 0.0, 1.0}; or
#    -  keyword with a 2D array of values, e.g. DISPERSERS (see below).
#    Note that each value may be a string or a number, however, it must be
#    capable of being interpreted correctly by the OT.
#    -  A vector of values is initiated by "{" and ended by "}", the values
#    being delimited by commas.
#    -  A 2D table is written as a series of vectors, i.e. each "row" of
#    the table should be written as a vector, and the rows placed one after
#    another inside a surround brace of curly brackets.  It is not necessary
#    to place each row on a separate line, but it is recommended.
#
# Notes:
#    -  Blank lines are allowed anywhere and ignored.
#    -  Comment lines (starting with "#") are ignored except that they
#    delimit blocks (as outlined above).
#    -  Keywords are case-insensitive, however, everything else is case
#    sensitive.

# History:
#    2000 April 4 (MJC):
#       Original version.
#    2000 April 27 (GSW):
#       Added L98 to filter list, exposure time estimates based on IRCAM
#       web pages, and a defbiasexptime item.
#    2000 May 14 (MJC):
#       Renamed L98 to Lp98, and M98 to Mp98 to match the names expected
#       by ukirt_prep.  Tidied the prologue to be more readable.
#    2000 July 6 (MJC):
#       Enabled POLARISERS.
#    2000 August 3 (GSW):
#       Added setting of default acquistion mode as a function of filter
#       to the table of exposure times.
#       Also corrected values in exposure-time table according to Sandy's
#       requests, and fixed the missing comma delimiters in the expousre
#       table.
#    2000 August 18 (MJC):
#       Made POLARISERS and READAREAS lookup tables including their X
#       and Y instrument apertures.
#    2000 December 8 (MJC):
#       Revise X-Y instrument apertures to Russell's latest measurement.
#    2000 December 27 (MJC):
#       Revise X-Y instrument apertures to AJA's latest measurement.
#    2001 January 23 (MJC):
#       Revise X-Y instrument apertures after dichroic change.
#    2001 April 25 (MJC):
#       Revise X instrument apertures using CJD's measurements.
#    2001 June 22 (MJC):
#       Revise X-Y instrument apertures after coming off the telescope.
#    2001 July 10 (MJC):
#       Revise X-Y instrument apertures for prism.
#    2001 October 29 (MJC):
#       Revise X-Y instrument apertures after being off the telescope
#       Was 4.88, 10.30.  Prism apertures unchanged.
#    2002 March 25 (MJC):
#       Switch the port to East from West.
#    2002 May 14 (MJC):
#       Removed narrow-band filters 3.6nbLp, 4.0c, BrA, 3.4nbL, 3.5mbL.
#       Add 1.57c, 1.644Fe, and 2.32CO narrow-band filters using BrG
#       exposure-time table provisionally.
