<h2>Advanced Topics</h2>

So far we have described preparation using the library sequence "as
is". This section covers some topics of interest to anyone wishing to
manipulate or add to the standard library sequences in order to create
some of the less common observing modes that are sometimes
required. It assumes that you are familiar with the material presented
in the main part of the tutorial.

<h3><a name="placement">A note about placement</a></h3>

As you may have gathered by now, the Science Program is a tree
structure and the placement of elements in that structure has a lot of
significance<p>

For example, look at the example below of a Science Program containing
three MSBs - focus on the location of the two Site Quality components:<p>

<img src="images/inheritance.gif" alt="Inheritance"><p>

What does this mean? The first Site Quality component is on the same
level of indentation, and therefore the same level of branching, as the
MSBs. If that was the only Site Quality component present <em> it
would apply to all MSBs in the Science Program</em>. As it is, the
first MSB has a site quality inside it (technically: within its
scope). So the first MSB will be scheduled using the criteria of the
Site Quality component inside it, and the second and third MSBs will
use the first Site Quality component since they lack one of their
own. The technical term for this behaviour is "inheritance" for those
familiar with it already.<p>

Common uses for inheritance are e.g. to place the Het Setup outside
the MSBs if you want to observe multiple sources at the same frequency.
Conversely, the Target Component can be placed outside multiple MSBs
are needed on the same target. However, carefully read the next item
on the interaction of the Het. and Target component.<p>

See the section on <a href="advanced.html#andor">"AND and OR Folders"</a> on 
how an AND folder can be used to group observations and use inheritance within
that group.<p>


<h3><a name="velocities">Velocities: The Het and Target Component.</a></h3>

It used to be that the receiver tuning, including the source velocity,
were specified in the Heterodyne Component while the source
coordinates needed to be entered in the Target Component. Half of our
observers were very happy with this, since they prefered to observe
all their sources with the same receiver setup. The other half of the
observers complained bitterly since they wanted to be able to read in
the sources <em>and</em> velocities from a catalog and center the
bandpass for each.<p>

Hence the OT now allows for the observing velocity to the specified
in the Heterodyne Component <em>or</em> the Target Component. But this
has made life a bit more complicated.<p>

The description of the <a href="het_example.html#het_thsc">Heterodyne
Setup component</a> should have made it clear that it uses the
velocity to compute the approximate sky frequency as a check whether
the line falls within the tuning range, to show the setup in the
frequency editor etc. However, it can <em><b>only</b></em> do that if
it has access to the velocity information. In the case where the
      velocity information 
has been put in the Target Component, this <em>requires</em> the components
to be at the same level of indentation. If this is not the case, the 
Het. Component will assume a velocity of 0 km/s.<p>

<em>Note that is only a problem within the OT: when MSBs are submitted
for observation the tree structure from the OT is unrolled and for
each observation the appropriate Het Setup and Target Component are
paired up.</em><p>

In general, this is not a problem for Galactic sources since the
overall parameters of the observation of a molecular line (center
frequency, atmospheric transparency, receiver characteritics) don't
significantly differ from source to source. That of course may not be
the case for extra-galactic and high-z sources: vary the velocity or
red-shift enough and the line may shift completely out of the band or
into an atmospheric absorption line for some of the sources (it has
happened!). The Het. Component will notify you of (un)available
transitions for a particular molecule and the Frequency Editor will
show the transmission at the observing frequency, but only if it
can find the velocity of the observation.<p>

<small>Small print: which is one of the reasons that we advice to
always select a 'Molecule' and 'Transition' from the drop-down
list, rather than typing a frequency manually.</small><p>

In summary, the following sample layouts allow for the Het. Component
to obtain the velocity from the Target Component:

<pre>
    *MSB                           *MSB                           *AND                      
      o Het Setup             	     o Site Quality                 o Het Setup             	 
      o Site Quality           	     o Observation                  o Site Quality           	        
      o Target Information             - Het Setup                  o Target Information
      o Observation                    - Target Information         o MSB1            
        - Sequence                     - Sequence                     - Observation    
           ...                            ...                            + Sequence
                                                                           ...
                                                                    o MSB2
                                                                           ...
</pre>


In the following samples the Het. Setup will <em>not</em> be able to access the velocity:

<pre>
    *MSB                           *MSB                           *AND                      
      o Het Setup             	     o Site Quality                 o Het Setup             	 
      o Site Quality           	     o Target Setup                 o Site Quality           	        
      o Observation                  o Observation                  o MSB1              
        - Target Information           - Het Setup                    - Target Information
        - Sequence                     - Sequence                     - Observation    
           ...                            ...                              ...
                                                                    o MSB2
                                                                      -  Target Information
                                                                             ...
</pre>


<h3><a name="replication">Generating a programme from a catalogue
file</a></h3>

If you have many sources which you wish to observe in a similar way
and do not wish to go through the rigmarole of editing a target
component for each one, there is a way to generate a science programme
from a template MSB and a text (ASCII) catalog file. This uses a
service at our site - you need an internet connection to do this.<p>


Start with a science program which contains the template MSB that you
wish to use for the replication, but <em>LEAVE THE NAME AND
COORDINATES IN THE TARGET COMPONENT BLANK</em> (for example, a
template MSB you have retrieved from the ACSIS library). Your catalog
file should be of the format:

<pre>
PKS0106         01 08 38.771 + 01 35 00.32 RJ
3C84            03 19 48.160 + 41 30 42.10 RJ  
3C120           04 33 11.096 + 05 21 15.62 RJ
PKS0438         04 40 17.180 - 43 33 08.60 RJ
</pre>

The catalog format is not blank space sensitive - sourceplot and JCMT
catalog files will work as is, provided they do not contain planets or
objects with orbital elements. <p>

Under the edit menu, there is an option called "Replicate from
catalog". Choose this action:<p>

<img src="images/replicate.gif" alt="Replication"><p>

A file selector window will pop up which allows you to choose the
location of the catalog file. Once you have done this, the OT will
contact our site and after a short delay will pop up a new science
programme window containing multiple MSBs. So if you had an MSB with
one blank target component and a catalog file with 12 sources, you
will get back a science programme with 12 MSBs, whose target
components have been filled in using the information from your
catalog.<p>

Of course you may have to tweak the MSBs further, such as giving them
more informative titles and tweaking the number of integrations on
each source.  It is also not yet possible for the source replicator to
    insert source velocities from the catalog into the MSBs.<p>


<h3><a name="constraints">Additional Scheduling Constraints</a></h3>

You can place additional scheduling constraints on some or all of your
MSBs. To set up a scheduling constraint component for all your MSBs,
return to your science programme component at the top, then click on
"component" on the left icon bar as shown below. This will bring up a
number of choices - select "Sched.Constraints". This will drop in a
Scheduling Constraints component at the top of your programme, which
will therefore apply to all MSBs. To make this apply to only a
specific MSB, place the scheduling constraint inside it.<p>

<img src="images/constraints.gif" alt="Constraint"><p>


The scheduling constraints component allows you to:

<ul>
<li> specify a specific time window in which you want your
observations to be taken. Needless to say setting this too narrowly
will reduce your chances of being scheduled, so only do this if there
is a valid scientific reason<p>

<li> set a rescheduling action, that will schedule an MSB that has
been completed to reappear after a certain number of days. If you have
been allocated time for a project that requires periodic monitoring,
you may wish to ask us for more information on how this works. <p>

<li> by default, a target is considered observable if it is between 30
and 88 degrees of elevation for the entire duration of its MSB. If you
wish to specify a lower elevation criterion (eg. for a very low or
	very high
declination source) you may do so here.<p>

<li> restrict a target to being observed only before or after
transit. Again, note that this criterion will be applied for the
entire estimated duration of the MSB, so only do this if it is
scientifically vital.<p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="andor">OR and AND Folders</a></h3>

Within a science program, you can use OR and AND folders to group your
MSBs.  These folders can be very useful for organising and managing
your observing programme as the semester progresses. Especially note
the comment below on an "alternative" use for an AND folder to avoid
having to reproduce information that is common to several MSBs<p>

An OR folder can contain N items, and you can set the "Select" counter
on the OR folder to indicate that you'd like any subset of size M to
be observed.  For example, if you wanted to try to detect the CO line
in an object, but were not concerned in which transition (either 3-2
or 2-1), one could use a top level OR folder which contained a target
information component and two MSBs as shown below. The user should set
the "Select" counter of the OR folder to 1 to indicate that just 1 of
the MSBs should be executed (not both). <p>

<img src="images/or_example.gif" alt="or example"><p>

Another application of OR folders is managing available telescope time
for projects with a large number of potential targets. Suppose an
observer wants to observe from a sample of 40 potential
targets. Further suppose that some of the objects will require follow
up observations towards the end of a semester and telescope time is
somewhat limited (i.e. not enough to observe them all once and follow
up the interesting ones). One solution would be to put the 40 MSBs for
the sample into an OR folder, then set the "select" switch to, say, 10
objects. This will mean that no more than 10 objects will be observed
from the sample. This can be used to ensure that all of the telescope
does not get used up in making first observations, and that some time
will be left over for follow up observations. This kind of programme
management can involve the observer, in conjunction with the support
astronomer, dynamically altering the programme in the light of past
observations, results of data reduction and available telescope
time.<p>

An AND folder <strong>does not</strong> influence the availability of
its contents, as an OR folder can, once an MSB inside it has been
observed.  Instead, they simply enable observations to be grouped
together. In the example below, AND folders are used to indicate that
the observer would prefer to end up with observations A and B or X and
Y rather than A and X and A and Y.  The order of observations, and
which get done, will still depend only on project priority, source
availability and weather. If the observer absolutely needs two targets
observed to get any meaningful scientific result, they should go in
the same MSB rather than in an AND folder - do not forget MSBs are
allowed to contain multiple targets. <p>

<img src="images/and_example.gif" alt="and example"><p>

<br>
An <em><b>alternative</b></em> use for an AND folder is to avoid having to reproduce
information that is common to several MSBs - the site quality, Target
info, and/or Het Setup for example.  An individual component can be
pulled out of the MSBs and set into the hierarchy at the AND folder
level.  In the following example, we have been allocated both bands 1
and 2 for our project; however, because of differences in their
expected fluxes we want to observe targets A and B in band 1 and
targets C and D in band 2.<p>

<img src="images/and_example2.gif" alt="and example2"><p>

<h3><a name="survey">Survey Container</a></h3>

<p>The survey container is an extremely useful tool when you want to
carry out the same type of observations of a large number of
sources. It works similar to the replication example above, but it
does not replicate the MSBs in the OT, only in the database. I.e. a
single observation for a target list with 100 sources will have 1 MSB
in the OT, but 100 MSBs in the database after uploading your science
program.

However the meaning of MSB remains the same: the whole
of the MSB must be doable for it to come up in the queue. Corollary: it
is a Bad Idea to include targets over a wide range of RA in one survey
container.<br>
<br>
Here is what you see when you click on the Container itself:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 569px; height: 548px;" alt="" src="images/survey_container_2.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
To manually add and remove positions, use "Add" and "Remove" buttons at
the bottom of the panel. Here is a completed container:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 548px; height: 587px;" alt="" src="images/survey_container_4.png"><br>
</div>

<br>
Note the "Target Information" Tab. Each target has its own target info,
in a format identical to the familiar Target Component:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 568px; height: 546px;" alt="" src="images/survey_container_3.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Survey Targets</span> tab,
there is a "load" button. This allows you, if you're not using the SDT
to populate your Container, to upload a set of targets from a text file
in the following format (slightly different from the format for MSB
cloning):<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<pre>SURVEYID = Test
SCIENCE BGPS3097&nbsp; 18:34:12.03&nbsp; -08:22:57.3 FK5
REFERENCE GD2&nbsp; 18:31:12.06&nbsp; -07:59:05.2 FK5
SCIENCE BGPS3100&nbsp; 18:34:19.16&nbsp; -08:23:27.9 FK5
REFERENCE GD2&nbsp; 18:31:12.06&nbsp; -07:59:05.2 FK5
</pre>

<pre>:</pre>
<pre>etc.</pre>
</div>
<pre>&nbsp;<br></pre>
The first line is the Survey ID, which will become the title of the
survey container. This is prefixed to every supplied target name as
follows:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 593px; height: 88px;" alt="" src="images/survey_container_5.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
(so it is best to keep it short!).<br>
<br>

<h3><a name="proxy">To those behind a firewall: Setting your proxy server</a></h3>

If your host is behind a firewall, you may need to use a proxy server
to access remote catalogs via HTTP. This can be achieved by selecting
"preferences" from the OT "File" menu and then selecting the Proxy
server tab. You may then enter the name and port of your proxy server.
