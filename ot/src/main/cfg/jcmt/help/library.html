    <h1>Guide to the Library Contents</h1>

<p>
The libraries are provided to make preparing your observing program fast and
easy.  To open a library go to the &quot;File ...&quot; menu on the OT, and
select the one you need. There are currently two librararies available:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>SCUBA-2</li>
<li>ACSIS</li>
</ul>

<p>The SCUBA-2 library contains pre-defined observations that will be useful
when building SCUBA-2 based science programs. It is split into three parts:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><B>Scans</b></dt>

      <dd>These MSBs will form the bulk of a science program. Pre-defined
      observations are provided for scan-map. Each MSB consists of a science
      observation and corresponding calibration. All you need to do is copy
      the MSB into your science program and edit the target information and
      the number of integrations.</dd>

    </dl>

<p>

<p>The ACSIS library contains pre-defined observations that will be useful
when building Heterodyne-based science programs. It is split into three parts:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><B>Samples</b></dt> 

      <dd> Use these as the basis for single pointing heterodyne observations.</dd>

      <dt><B>Grids</b></dt>

      <dd> Use these for heterodyne observations which require more than one pointing per object. </dd>

      <dt><B>Scans</b></dt>

      <dd> Use these for preparing heterodyne scan mapped observations </dd>
    </dl>

<p>


If you have any questions on these libraries do not hesitate to contact your
      support scientist for help.</p>
