<h1>Guide to the Library Contents</h1>

<p>
The libraries are provided to make preparing your observing program fast and
easy.  To open a library go to the &quot;File ...&quot; menu on the OT, and
select the one you need. There are currently two librararies available:
</p>

<ul>
<li>SCUBA-2</li>
<li>ACSIS</li>
</ul>

<p>
The SCUBA-2 library contains pre-defined observations that will be useful
when building SCUBA-2 based science programs. It is split into three parts:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Scans</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        These MSBs will form the bulk of a science program. Pre-defined
        observations are provided for scan-map. Each MSB consists of a science
        observation and corresponding calibration. All you need to do is copy
        the MSB into your science program and edit the target information and
        the number of integrations.
        </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The ACSIS library contains pre-defined observations that will be useful
when building Heterodyne-based science programs. It is split into three parts:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Samples</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        Use these as the basis for single pointing heterodyne observations.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Grids</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        Use these for heterodyne observations which require more than one pointing per object.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Scans</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        Use these for preparing heterodyne scan mapped observations.
        </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
If you have any questions on these libraries do not hesitate to contact your
support scientist for help.
