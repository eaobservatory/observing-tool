<p>The JCMT-OT was developed at the <a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk">ATC</a>
by
<b>Martin Folger</b> and at the JAC by <b>Shaun de Witt</b> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Sam Hart</span>, with scientific input from
<b>Tim Jenness</b> (JAC),
<b>Kate Isaak</b> (MRAO), <b>Frossie Economou</b> (JAC) and <b>Bill
Dent</b>
The Heterodyne observation library was written by <b>Jamie Leech</b>
(JAC) and <b>Frossie Economou</b> (JAC).</p>
<p>The JCMT-OT was derived from a pre-release version of the <a
 href="http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/OThelp/otIndex.html">Gemini OT</a>
(v0.50)
and the old <a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT">UKIRT</a> <a
 href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/software/orac/">ORAC-OT</a>
(which was itself based on an extremely old version of the Gemini OT).</p>
<p>The OT forms part of the <a href="http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu/">JAC
Observation
Management Project</a>. This is a joint JCMT/UKIRT project to improve
the
efficiency and interactiveness of flexible-scheduling at both
telescopes. The
OMP-OT (of which the JCMT-OT is a derivative) provides features for
scheduling
and improved XML format and database connectivity.</p>
<p>The OMP project team consists of (JAC unless stated otherwise): <b>Frossie
Economou</b> (project manager), <b>Tim Jenness</b>, <b>Remo Tilanus</b>,
<b>Paul Hirst</b>, <b>Kate Isaak</b> (MRAO), <b>Martin Folger</b>
(ATC),
<b>Mathew Rippa</b>, <b>Kynan Delorey</b>, <b>Brad Cavanagh</b> and <b>Shaun
de Witt</b>.</p>
