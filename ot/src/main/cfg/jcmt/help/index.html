        <h1>The JCMT OT primer</h1>

<p> 
This document is a primer on how to use the JCMT Observing Tool (JCMT
OT) to prepare and submit observations (see <a href="faq.html#why">Why
do I have to do this?</a>). It assumes that you have already
downloaded and installed the software (see our <a
href="download.html">download page</a> - make sure you have downloaded
the latest version!). If you are using a JAC or summit machine, the
software is already installed. You will also need the <a
href="http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/issuepwd.pl">OMP password</a>
for your project in order to be able to <a
href="recap.html#database">upload</a> your MSBs to our observing
database.

<p>
If you are viewing this document through the JCMT-OT Help menu, there
may be a more up-to-date version on our web site at 
<a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/software/jcmtot/">
http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/software/jcmtot/</a>.

<p>
If, after reading this guide you have any questions about preparing
your observations, please consult with your "Friend of the Project"
(see
<a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/allocations">
http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/allocations</a>),
or email <a
href="mailto:jcmtot@jach.hawaii.edu">jcmtot@jach.hawaii.edu</a>.



<h2>Contents</h2>

      Because the OT is a graphical tool, the initial description of
      how to use it will undoubtedly appear long-winded. But if you use
      the text and screen shots to give yourself some practice you'll
      find that you'll actually be able to prepare your program in a
      modest number of steps.<p>

 <h2><a name="gen">General information</a></h2>

<p> This version of the <em><b>JCMT OT</b></em> enables users to build
their science program for heterodyne and SCUBA-2 observations. A <a
href="het_example.html#het_msblib">heterodyne template library</a> and <a
href="scuba2_example.html#start">SCUBA-2 template library</a> are provided
which allow users to create MSBs for any available observing mode: <em>Samples, Grids,
Jiggles</em> and <em>Scans</em> for heterodyne, and <em>PONG </em>or <em>DAISY scans</em> for SCUBA-2. 

Investigators are urged to
carefully inspect the example for a beam-switched observation below
and to read the more extensive explanation and instructions presented
for each observing mode. While the components will look familiar to
experienced JCMT observers, most have changed, sometimes in a fairly
subtle manner.

<p>
<b><font color=firebrick><h3><i><li>Calibrations</i></h3></font></b>

<p>
The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable a more
flexible inclusion of calibration observations: presently there is no
easy way to add calibration observation MSBs.  The JCMT telescope
operators (TSS) will insert calibrations, pointings, foci, etc. into
the observing sequence as appropriate.  Without any specific
instructions in the science program calibrations will be carried out
by observing a 'standard' line in a suitable calibration source.

<p> 
PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and wishes
regarding calibrations in the <i>Calibration Note</i> to the TSS and
observers. A sample note has been included with the library templates.
For information on standard sources, lines, and observational setup, see:
<a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/spectral_line/Standards/standards.html" target="_blank">
JCMT Heterodyne Standards</a>. 
<em>Please be aware that the submm positions for calibrators as used
at the JCMT may differ substantially from the the ones in archives
such as SIMBAD.</em>

<p>
There are several options for calibrations and ways to customize them:
<ol>

<li>No special calibration MSBs are provided in the Science Program:
the calibrations will be carried out on a suitable calibration source
selected by the TSS at a 'standard' frequency, possibly different from
MSB tuning or redshift. For many applications, this is the most
appropriate option.</li>

<p> 
<li> A number of separate calibration MSBs on suitable targets are
added to the science program, clearly identified as calibrations in
their title. Typically the set of calibration MSBs should cover the
RA-range of the science observations to ensure that at least one
calibration MSB is available at any time.  PIs can customize the <i>Het
setup</i> but need to take care to pick an appropriate
switching-scheme for each calibrator chosen.  The TSS will insert the
calibration MSBs into the observing queue as needed and per
instruction in the science program.

<ul><li> 
The ACSIS library has a set of special template MSBs for a
position-switch, beam-switch, or scan calibration. The MSBs start
with a series of (optional) pointing and focus observations. The
calibration itself is a regular observation that has been marked as a
calibration.  Configure the <i>Het setup</i> and <i>Target
Component</i> to customize the calibration for your project. Typically
choose either a position-switch, beam-switch, or scan calibration,
depending on the selected calibration target (many of which require a
position-switch).  Observational details for the calibrators can be
found at this location:
<a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/spectral_line/Standards/standards.html" target="_blank">
JCMT Heterodyne Standards</a>.  The calibration MSBs should be added
to the science program with a high priority (low number) and high
repeat counter to ensure that they will come up prominently and
repeatedly in the JCMT Query Tool.
</li></ul>
</li>

<p>
<li>Calibration observations are part of the science MSBs:

<ul>
<li> Embed the calibration observation of a specific standard source
and line in your science MSB by copying and pasting the desired
components from the calibration template described above under
option 2 (please read those instructions). The MSB should look like:

<pre>
       -------------------------
       MSB
         ...
         Het setup
         Science Target
</pre>
<font color=green>
<pre>
         Calibration Observation (marked as Calibration)
</pre>         
</font>
<pre>
         Science Observation 
       -------------------------
</pre>         


Please be aware of <i>inheritance</i>: in the example above you will need to
add another <i>Target Component</i> inside Calibration Observations with the
coordinates and offsets of the calibrator! Likewise, if the
calibration needs to be done at a different frequency, another <i>Het
setup</i> needs to be added inside the Calibration Observation. This will
result in the appropriate retune between the calibrator and the
science target. This should NOT be done for the manually tuned
RxW. <b>WARNING:</b> If you include a calibration observation in this manner,
both your target and calibration source must be observable before the
MSB can be scheduled, which can severely restrict the night-time
available to the project in case of an unfortunate combination of
calibration and science targets.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>


<p>
Issues to consider regarding calibrations may be:
<ul>

<li>How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
spec.</li>

<li>Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
done with the <i>Het setup</i> of the science observation and, if not
close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
night-to-night?</li>

<li>Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
because of the lower resolution.</li>

<li>Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
the standard frequencies or should the <i>Het setup</i> from the
science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
accurate.</li>

</ul>

<p>
<b><font color=firebrick><h3><i><li>Integration times</i></h3></font></b>
<p>
Note that throughout this document <b>integration times</b> are the
<em>"on"-source</em> time only, instead of <em>"on+off"</em> as
before.

<p>
<b><font color=firebrick><li>Advanced OT Topics</font></b>

<p> 
There is a section on <a href="advanced.html#advanced">Advanced
Topics</a> that observers should read. There you will learn more about
how the Target and Heterodyne components can interact with each other,
and also how to use the <a href="advanced.html#andor">AND/OR
folders</a> when you have many MSBs in your programme. <a
href="advanced.html#survey">Survey containers</a> may significantly
simplify your setup if used properly.

<p>
<b><font color=firebrick><h3><i><li>Program Validation</i></h3></font></b>

<p> 
Please be sure to <i>carefully</i> double-check your program and to
<b><i>validate</i></b> after high-lighting the top-most entry in the
OT program. The quoted Observing times are approximate and estimates
of overheads are based on limited tests. Check the validation messages
and contact your <a
href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/allocations">Friend of the
Project</a> if you need help.


<p>
<b><font color=firebrick><h3><i><li>Detailed description of Observing Modes</i></h3></font></b>

<p> A detailed description of the various observing modes, rms noise,
and durations is available as a document <a
href="het_obsmodes.html"><i>Heterodyne Obsmodes</i></a>.  <i>Even
though the information is not required in order to set up a science
program, experienced as well as novice JCMT observers are encouraged
to read the document as a general background.</i>


    <h2><a name="gs">Getting started</a></h2>

    Before we get started, a few words about the OT. The purpose of
    the OT is to fully specify the observations you wish to be carried
    out at the telescope. It
    is quite a powerful tool; here we will simply see how to prepare a
    typical observing project and point you to further sources of
    information as necessary.<p>


      Ok, let's do this. Start the JCMT Observing Tool.<p>


    You will see two windows pop up. One has a colour picture of the
    telescope - that's the JCMT root window. You can use its menus to
    open and save files and fetch programs from our database. The
    window with the JCMT line drawing, which pops on top of the root
    window, provides a shortcut to some of the most common startup
    actions, so we call that the startup screen:<p>

      <img src="images/startup.gif" alt="Image of startup screen"><p>

    For now, press "Create New Program" on the startup screen. The
    startup window will be replaced by an science program window. If
    you are using a proxy server to connect to the internet now would
    be a good time to configure the OT to use this - see the
    instructions <a href="advanced.html#proxy"> here. </a>

<p>("Open Existing Program" lets you open a science program that
      you've previously edited and saved in your own computer system.  "Fetch
      Program" allows you to download a program that that you have
      completed and uploaded to our observing database.  To download
      the program, of course, you will need the <a
	href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/allocations/">project
	ID</a> 
      (e.g. m06bc18) and <a
	href="http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/issuepwd.pl">password</a>. 

    <h2><a name="ysp">Your science program</a></h2>

    Look at your blank science program window. It's essentially
    divided in four sections: 

    <ol>

      <li>the menu and general tool bars at the top
      <li>the program tool bar down the left side
      <li>the program panel in the middle
      <li>the editor panel on the right

</ol>


    The bar between the program panel and the editor panel can be
    dragged around to enlarge or reduce them.<p>


Currently, the only thing in your program panel is a "Science Program"
line. We'll add things to it later. For now, take the time to fill in
its details in the Science Program editor on the right. The most
important field here is the Project ID field. <em>You have to get this
right otherwise you will not be able to submit your program to
us</em>. Your project ID is what you were assigned when you submitted
your proposal for telescope time. It is of the form m06b followed by a
country letter and a two digit proposal number (sometimes followed by
      a letter). You can also find your country and 
proposal number in our web page of <a
href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/allocations/">time
allocations</a>.<p> <img src="images/sciprog.gif" alt="Science
Program window"><p>

Also on the panel are estimates of the total time the specified
program will take with and without optional observations, which are currently both 0 since we haven't specified any
observations yet. 


    <h2><a name="syp">Saving your progress</a></h2>

    Now that we've done something we can save it. Open the File menu
    in your Science Program window and choose "Save As...".<p>

      <img src="images/filesave.gif" alt="File Save menu"><p>

      You will be prompted for a filename and so on:<p>


      <img src="images/saveas.gif" alt="Save As window"><p>

      The file format is XML, which is a text (not binary) format that
      you can read in later with the OT, or email to your
      collaborators. If you have a question, you can also email your
      file to your "Friend of the Project" (FOP; see <a
	href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/allocations/">allocations</a> web page) along with your question.<p>   

      You might have noticed that the title of your Science Program
      was italics and now that you've saved the file, the title is
      normal font. When you edit a component 
      of your Science Program its title changes font to indicate that
      you need to save your work.<p>

    <h2><a name="ggtm">Getting going: The MSB</a></h2>

    Time to step back for a moment. JCMT is a flexibly scheduled
    facility. But what is it that we are actually scheduling? The
    quantum of scheduling is a Minimum Schedulable Block, or MSB. An
    MSB consists of one or more scientifically meaningful observations
    as well as any calibrations required to fully reduce the
    data. <em>An MSB will always be executed at the telescope in its
    entirety</em>. For more information see <a href="faq.html#msb">What makes
    a good MSB?</a> but for the moment bear in mind that the most
    efficient MSB consists of a 0.5 to 2 hour observation on a single
    science target and any necessary calibrations.

      
<p>Now that you've seen the basics of creating an observing program,
      and know what an MSB is, you will want to start creating your
      own.  We've created a library of MSBs for the most commonly used
      observing modes which are currently supported.  For a
      description of each, and help in creating your own program,
      please consult the <a href="het_example.html">heterodyne
	tutorial</a>.

    <h2><a name="ggtm">Uploading your program to the Observing Database</a></h2>

<p>Once you've created your MSBs and validated that they are correct,
      you will need to upload the program to our observing database so
      that the observations can be carried out.  Check <a
	href="recap.html#database">submitting MSBs</a> for
      instructions on how to do so.
