    <h2><a name="recap">Recap</a></h2>

    Phew! You've finally reached the end - but what did you really
    <strong>have</strong> to do so far?

<ul>

      <li>Fill in your Science Program details<p>
      <li>Fetch a template MSB from the library<p>
      <li>Set the target co-ordinates

</ul>

    And probably:<p>

<ul>
     

      <li>Increase the number of integrations, repeats and MSBs
      <li>Modify the chop position<p>
      <li>Make an informative note for the observer
</ul>

When you think you are happy with your MSB, your are
<strong>strongly</strong> advised to validate the MSB before
submitting it to the database. To do this, click on your science programme and press the "Validation"
button on the bar above. This will tell you if there's anything
seriously wrong with your MSBs - the output can be a bit cryptic
though - so do ask us if you can't figure out what it means. You can
also check individual MSBs and observations.


    <h2><a name="database">Submitting to our database</a></h2>

    When you are happy about the MSBs you have created you can submit
    them to our database. As soon as you do this, they may be observed
    so don't do this unless you mean it! To submit your program to our
    database, pull down the Database menu on your Science Program window:<p>

      <img src="images/submit.gif" alt="Submitting"><p>
    <p>
      
      A little window will pop up using the Project ID that you put
      into your Science Program at the start (see <a href="#ysp">Your
      science program</a>). It will also ask you for a password. You
      can get a password from our password generator at <a
      href="http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/issuepwd.pl">
      http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/issuepwd.pl </a>. If you
      forget it, go there to get another one. If you are PI on more
      than one project you'll need a password per project so that you
      can share it with your different sets of Co-Is. The password you
      get will also allow you access to your <a
      href="http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/feedback.pl">Feedback
      Area</a> to check on the progress of your project, double-check
      your MSBs, retrieve your data and exchange views with our
      staff. Check it out. Both the above links can also be found off
      on OMP home page <a href="http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu/">http://omp.jach.hawaii.edu</a><p>

      When you do get your password and submit your program, you will
      receive a summary of all the MSBs contained in your
      program. Check to make sure that everything is okay. If the
      are major problems with you science program the database may complain
      and refuse to accept the submission. If you don't understand what
      the problem is, email us along with a copy of the problematic
      project, but check the <a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions
      </a> for hints first. 

      One last thing: don't forget to save your Science Program to
      your local file too. But - always start a new session by
      fetching the program from our database before making any
      changes, since our system modifies your science program to
      indicate which observations have been observed.<p>

      Aloha, mahalo, and clear skies.<p>
