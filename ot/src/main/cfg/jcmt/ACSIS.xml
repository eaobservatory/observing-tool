 This is a note outlining good practice in note writing for heterodyne
 MSB. PLEASE replace this note with your own note or delete altogether
 BEFORE submitting the MSB.


Things to include in your notes
-------------------------------

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

            <note>Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

            <note>Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

----------------

 This is a note outlining good practice in note writing for heterodyne
 MSB. PLEASE replace this note with your own note or delete altogether
 BEFORE submitting the MSB.


Things to include in your notes
-------------------------------

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

            <note>Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

 This is a note outlining good practice in note writing for heterodyne
 MSB. PLEASE replace this note with your own note or delete altogether
 BEFORE submitting the MSB.


Things to include in your notes
-------------------------------

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

Things to include in your notes
-------------------------------

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

            <note>Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

            <note>Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

----------------

 This is a note outlining good practice in note writing for heterodyne
 MSB. PLEASE replace this note with your own note or delete altogether
 BEFORE submitting the MSB.


Things to include in your notes
-------------------------------

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

            <note>A note about notes
----------------

 This is a note outlining good practice in note writing for heterodyne
 MSB. PLEASE replace this note with your own note or delete altogether
 BEFORE submitting the MSB.


Things to include in your notes
-------------------------------

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

SPECIAL WARNING FOR RxW OBSERVATIONS:

RxW is a manually tuned receiver. Calibrations performed at a 
frequency different from the tuning used in the Science MSB
may result in a significant increase of the overhead.
=====================================

Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

 This is a note outlining good practice in note writing for heterodyne
 MSB. PLEASE replace this note with your own note or delete altogether
 BEFORE submitting the MSB.


Things to include in your notes
-------------------------------

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

SPECIAL WARNING FOR RxW OBSERVATIONS:

RxW is a manually tuned receiver. Calibrations performed at a 
frequency different from the tuning used in the Science MSB
may result in a significant increase of the overhead.
=====================================

Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

Things to include in your notes
-------------------------------

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

SPECIAL WARNING FOR RxW OBSERVATIONS:

RxW is a manually tuned receiver. Calibrations performed at a 
frequency different from the tuning used in the Science MSB
may result in a significant increase of the overhead.
=====================================

Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

SPECIAL WARNING FOR RxW OBSERVATIONS:

RxW is a manually tuned receiver. Calibrations performed at a 
frequency different from the tuning used in the Science MSB
may result in a significant increase of the overhead.
=====================================

Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

            <note>A note about notes
----------------

 This is a note outlining good practice in note writing for heterodyne
 MSB. PLEASE replace this note with your own note or delete altogether
 BEFORE submitting the MSB.


Things to include in your notes
-------------------------------

* Calibration details

1) Overall observing strategy for your science program. A paragraph
   conveying the general ideas behind your science program is useful
   for the observer (who may not be an expert in your field) and the
   TSS. (Check "show to the Observer").

2) Details of calibration observations.
   Spell out any specific calibrations you require in the note which is selected 
  as "show-to-observer". Example  instructions might include:

   "Short sample on a nearby spectral line standard with a good
   CO(3-2) line e.g. OMC1".

    and/or

   "Short sample on a point-like planet (e.g. Uranus), with same
   backend set up as science target."

   In short, you'll at least want something to check back-end setup
   and receiver performance (e.g. a spectral line standard). Optional is
   an efficiency measurement on a planet to check the convertion
   of the measured antenna temperature to an astrophysical brightness
   temperature. However, isolated efficiency observations scatter 
   considerably and using a suitable average of archived values may be
   preferential.

3) If you want more specific standard or calibration measurement you should
   make a separate MSBs with these measurements or include them as extra
   observation in your MSBs. Calibration observations should be flagged as
   'calibration' on their title page to prevent unnecessary repeats.</note>

            <note>=====================================
SPECIAL WARNING FOR RxW OBSERVATIONS:

RxW is a manually tuned receiver. Calibrations performed at a 
frequency different from the tuning used in the Science MSB
may result in a significant increase of the overhead.
=====================================

Calibrations:
----------

The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable 
a more flexible inclusion of calibration observations:
presently there is no easy way to insert calibration observation MSBs.
Without any specific instructions in the science program the operators
will insert calibrations by observing one of the 'standard' lines in a
calibration source. There are several options for the calibration: 
==&gt; See the 'Calibration Instructions' in the Optional Calibration Template
in the ACSIS OT library for additional instructions regarding options 2
and 3.

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and
wishes regarding calibrations in this 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers.

Examples:

1) No specific calibration MSB is provided. Calibrations can be carried
    out on a suitable calibration source selected by the TSS and at a 
    'standard' frequency, possibly different from MSB tuning or redshift.

2) A set of separate calibration MSBs, named ...., is available for use with 
    this MSB. Please select one suitable for the time of observation, the MSBs
    span the range of RAs in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are embedded as an (optional) part of this
    MSB.

Please make sure to add additional wishes and requests to the note!
Issue to consider may be:

- How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
  sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
  spec.

- Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
  different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
  done with the "Het setup" of the science observation and, if not
  close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
  that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
  night-to-night?

- Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
  science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
  a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
  calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
  because of the lower resolution.

- Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
  the standard frequencies or should the "Het setup" from the
  science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
  of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
  accurate.</note>

          <note>Calibration Template Instructions
----------------------------

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and wishes
regarding calibrations in the 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers. A sample note has been included with the library templates.
For information on standard sources, lines, and observational setup, see:
 
http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/spectral_line/Standards/standards.html

Please be aware that the submm positions for calibrators as used
at the JCMT may differ substantially from the the ones in archives
such as SIMBAD.

There are several options for calibrations and ways to customize them:

1) No special calibration MSBs are provided in the Science Program:
   the calibrations will be carried out on a suitable calibration source
   selected by the TSS at a 'standard' frequency, possibly different from
   MSB tuning or redshift. For many applications, this is the most 
   appropriate option.

2) A number of separate calibration MSBs on suitable targets are added
   to the science program, clearly identified as calibrations in their
   title. Typically the set of calibration MSBs should cover the
   RA-range of the science observations to ensure that at least one
   calibration MSB is available at any time.  PIs can customize the
   "Het setup" but need to take care to pick an appropriate
   switching-scheme for each calibrator chosen.  The TSS will insert
   the calibration MSBs into the observing queue as needed and per
   instruction in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are part of the science MSBs


Ad 2. Adding separate Calibration MSBs:
----------------------------------
 
The ACSIS library has a set of special template MSBs for a
position-switch, beam-switch, or raster calibration. The MSBs start
with a series of (optional) pointing and focus observations. The
calibration itself is a regular observation that has been marked as a
calibration.  Configure the "Het setup" and "Target
Component" to customize the calibration for your project. Typically
choose either a position-switch, beam-switch, or raster calibration,
depending on the selected calibration target (many of which require a
position-switch).  Observational details for the calibrators can be
found at this location:
http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/spectral_line/Standards/standards.html
The calibration MSBs should be added to the science program with a
high priority (low number) and high repeat counter to ensure that they
will come up prominently and repeatedly in the JCMT Query Tool.


Ad 3. Embedding Calibration observations as part of the science MSBs:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Embed the calibration observation of a specific standard source
and line in your science MSB by copying and pasting the desired
components from the calibration template described above under
Ad. 2 (please read those instructions). The MSB should look like:

       -------------------------
       MSB
         ...
         Het setup
         Science Target
         Calibration Observation (marked as Calibration)
         Science Observation 
       -------------------------


Please be aware of "inheritance": in the example above you will need to
add another "Target Component" inside Calibration Observations with the
coordinates and offsets of the calibrator! Likewise, if the
calibration needs to be done at a different frequency, another "Het
setup" needs to be added inside the Calibration Observation. This will
result in the appropriate retune between the calibrator and the
science target. This should NOT be done for the manually tuned
RxW. WARNING: If you include a calibration observation in this manner,
both your target and calibration source must be observable before the
MSB can be scheduled, which can severely restrict the night-time
available to the project in case of an unfortunate combination of
calibration and science targets.</note>

          <note>Calibration Template Instructions
----------------------------

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and wishes
regarding calibrations in the 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers. A sample note has been included with the library templates.
For information on standard sources, lines, and observational setup, see:
 
http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/spectral_line/Standards/standards.html

Please be aware that the submm positions for calibrators as used
at the JCMT may differ substantially from the the ones in archives
such as SIMBAD.

There are several options for calibrations and ways to customize them:

1) No special calibration MSBs are provided in the Science Program:
   the calibrations will be carried out on a suitable calibration source
   selected by the TSS at a 'standard' frequency, possibly different from
   MSB tuning or redshift. For many applications, this is the most 
   appropriate option.

2) A number of separate calibration MSBs on suitable targets are added
   to the science program, clearly identified as calibrations in their
   title. Typically the set of calibration MSBs should cover the
   RA-range of the science observations to ensure that at least one
   calibration MSB is available at any time.  PIs can customize the
   "Het setup" but need to take care to pick an appropriate
   switching-scheme for each calibrator chosen.  The TSS will insert
   the calibration MSBs into the observing queue as needed and per
   instruction in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are part of the science MSBs


Ad 2. Adding separate Calibration MSBs:
----------------------------------
 
The ACSIS library has a set of special template MSBs for a
position-switch, beam-switch, or raster calibration. The MSBs start
with a series of (optional) pointing and focus observations. The
calibration itself is a regular observation that has been marked as a
calibration.  Configure the "Het setup" and "Target
Component" to customize the calibration for your project. Typically
choose either a position-switch, beam-switch, or raster calibration,
depending on the selected calibration target (many of which require a
position-switch).  Observational details for the calibrators can be
found at this location:
http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/spectral_line/Standards/standards.html
The calibration MSBs should be added to the science program with a
high priority (low number) and high repeat counter to ensure that they
will come up prominently and repeatedly in the JCMT Query Tool.


Ad 3. Embedding Calibration observations as part of the science MSBs:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Embed the calibration observation of a specific standard source
and line in your science MSB by copying and pasting the desired
components from the calibration template described above under
Ad. 2 (please read those instructions). The MSB should look like:

       -------------------------
       MSB
         ...
         Het setup
         Science Target
         Calibration Observation (marked as Calibration)
         Science Observation 
       -------------------------


Please be aware of "inheritance": in the example above you will need to
add another "Target Component" inside Calibration Observations with the
coordinates and offsets of the calibrator! Likewise, if the
calibration needs to be done at a different frequency, another "Het
setup" needs to be added inside the Calibration Observation. This will
result in the appropriate retune between the calibrator and the
science target. This should NOT be done for the manually tuned
RxW. WARNING: If you include a calibration observation in this manner,
both your target and calibration source must be observable before the
MSB can be scheduled, which can severely restrict the night-time
available to the project in case of an unfortunate combination of
calibration and science targets.</note>

          <note>Calibration Template Instructions
----------------------------

PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and wishes
regarding calibrations in the 'Calibration Note' to the TSS and
observers. A sample note has been included with the library templates.
For information on standard sources, lines, and observational setup, see:
 
http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/spectral_line/Standards/standards.html

Please be aware that the submm positions for calibrators as used
at the JCMT may differ substantially from the the ones in archives
such as SIMBAD.

There are several options for calibrations and ways to customize them:

1) No special calibration MSBs are provided in the Science Program:
   the calibrations will be carried out on a suitable calibration source
   selected by the TSS at a 'standard' frequency, possibly different from
   MSB tuning or redshift. For many applications, this is the most 
   appropriate option.

2) A number of separate calibration MSBs on suitable targets are added
   to the science program, clearly identified as calibrations in their
   title. Typically the set of calibration MSBs should cover the
   RA-range of the science observations to ensure that at least one
   calibration MSB is available at any time.  PIs can customize the
   "Het setup" but need to take care to pick an appropriate
   switching-scheme for each calibrator chosen.  The TSS will insert
   the calibration MSBs into the observing queue as needed and per
   instruction in the science program.

3) Calibration observations are part of the science MSBs


Ad 2. Adding separate Calibration MSBs:
----------------------------------
 
The ACSIS library has a set of special template MSBs for a
position-switch, beam-switch, or raster calibration. The MSBs start
with a series of (optional) pointing and focus observations. The
calibration itself is a regular observation that has been marked as a
calibration.  Configure the "Het setup" and "Target
Component" to customize the calibration for your project. Typically
choose either a position-switch, beam-switch, or raster calibration,
depending on the selected calibration target (many of which require a
position-switch).  Observational details for the calibrators can be
found at this location:
http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/spectral_line/Standards/standards.html
The calibration MSBs should be added to the science program with a
high priority (low number) and high repeat counter to ensure that they
will come up prominently and repeatedly in the JCMT Query Tool.


Ad 3. Embedding Calibration observations as part of the science MSBs:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Embed the calibration observation of a specific standard source
and line in your science MSB by copying and pasting the desired
components from the calibration template described above under
Ad. 2 (please read those instructions). The MSB should look like:

       -------------------------
       MSB
         ...
         Het setup
         Science Target
         Calibration Observation (marked as Calibration)
         Science Observation 
       -------------------------


Please be aware of "inheritance": in the example above you will need to
add another "Target Component" inside Calibration Observations with the
coordinates and offsets of the calibrator! Likewise, if the
calibration needs to be done at a different frequency, another "Het
setup" needs to be added inside the Calibration Observation. This will
result in the appropriate retune between the calibrator and the
science target. This should NOT be done for the manually tuned
RxW. WARNING: If you include a calibration observation in this manner,
both your target and calibration source must be observable before the
MSB can be scheduled, which can severely restrict the night-time
available to the project in case of an unfortunate combination of
calibration and science targets.</note>
