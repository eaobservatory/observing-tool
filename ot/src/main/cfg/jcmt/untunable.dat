# This file contains information on untunable bands which will be displayed 
# in the heterodyne frequency editor.  Currently, the only untunable bands
# are harmonics of the WVM.  The format is quite simply a list of frequencies
# with optional minimum/maximum frequencies (implemented in code, but
# currently non exist.
# This for a single frequency (in GHz), there would be a single entry like
# 222.865
# For ranges you can put in the following
# 521.625 521.825

# WVM harmonic lines
274.965
366.620
458.275

# Test data for ramge
