+++ January 2017 release

  - Updated Java webstart package information (e.g. new package name
    "JCMT-UKIRT Observing Tool").

  - The validator now more thoroughly checks for chop iterators for each
    beam-switched observation.

  - The validator warns if the radial velocity has been left at zero for
    heterodyne observations.

+++ July 2016 release

  - Added an example POL-2 MSB to the SCUBA-2 library.

+++ April 2016 release

  - Changed RxA3m IF frequency to 4 GHz.  Existing RxA3m heterodyne
    setup components should be recreated to use the new IF frequency.

  - Corrected name of H2CO 5 2 4 - 4 2 3 transition.  Existing heterodyne
    setup components using this transition should be updated as the old
    (incorrect) name will no longer be recognized.

+++ January 2016 release

  - Updated RxA3m receiver tuning information and made this the default
    instrument (in place of RxA3).  All RxA3 heterodyne setup components
    will need to be changed to take account of the new IF frequency used
    by RxA3m.  Note that the tuning range of RxA3m has been estimated as
    the same as that of RxA3.  The OT will be updated again once the exact
    tuning range of RxA3m is known.

  - Updated SCUBA-2 pong map parameters for sizes 2200-3000".  (This does
    not directly control the parameters used by the telescope but does
    improve the OT's time estimate for maps in this size range.)

  - Added the ability to specify allowed rotator (K-mirror) relative angles
    for HARP jiggle and stare observations.  You should only use this
    feature if you are sure your program requires it, otherwise the
    angles should be left all unselected (as they are by default).
    If you do restrict the angles, you may need to add a scheduling
    constraint in order to specify at which elevation your observation
    can be performed.

+++ December 2015 release

  - Rearranged observation panel so that HARP "Array Centred" option is
    not obscured by frequency switching parameters.

+++ July 2015 release

  - Updated the included documentation.

  - Updated the SCUBA-2 and ACSIS libraries.

  - Horizons query caching problem fixed on Windows.

  - Updated line catalog to include CII at 1900.5 GHz.

  - Adjusted automatic clearing of DRRecipe component settings.  Progams
    using multiple instruments should now be less problematic in this regard.

  - Added validation of heterodyne raster sample time.

  - Corrected automatic sideband changing when necessary for a new frequency
    so that the sideband is actually changed.

+++ February 2015 release

  - Updated JAC URLs to new EAO URLs (including OMP server).

  - Added an example 2 degree pong observation to the SCUBA-2 library.

  - Added choice of SCUBA-2 recipe "REDUCE_SCAN_ISOLATED_SOURCE".

    problems loading schema-compliant programs which the OT
    previously rejected.

  - Updated the RxA_SIOSO_250x2 special configuration due to a
    change to the name of the transition in the line catalogue.

  - Set a default earliest schedule date in the past.

  - When loading Survey Container positions from files, handle
    REFERENCE positions in a similar manner to SCIENCE positions.

+++ July 2013 release

  - Prevented nearby lines obscuring each other in the frequency
    editor's pop up menu.

+++ June 2013 release

  - Improved validation of DR Recipe components.

  - Increased FTS-2 variable mode resolution range.

+++ March 2013 release

  - Made RxA3 the default receiver again.  RxA3M is still present
    but should not be selected for now.

  - Issue a warning if changing to a narrower band receiver
    (e.g. RxA3M to RxA3) has put a spectral region out of range.
    When this happens the centre frequency of the band edge will
    be shown in the frequency configuration table, and the frequencies
    must be edited to create a useable tuning.

+++ February 2013 release

  - Added RxA3M as a new receiver.  RxA3 is still present in the
    OT to assist in converting programs to RxA3M, but it should
    not be selected for new programs.

+++ January 2013 release

  - Maximum memory usage increased to 1000M to avoid problems
    saving very large programs.

  - Updated line catalogue to include an SO2 line at 241GHz and
    H2CS line at 338GHz.

  - Upgraded JSky to version 3.

  - Included support for FTS-2 and POL-2.

+++ November 2012 release

    that we can use JSky3.  In this release the splash screen shows
    a warning if the Java version is older than this.

  - Two HDO lines at 225 and 241GHz added to the line catalogue.

  - Validator now checks for bare observations in survey containers.

  - Updated SCUBA-2 noise parameters to match the 13A call for proposals
    update to the online ITC.

    page to avoid problems where the orbital elements panel
    did not fit in the space assigned.

+++ August 2012 release

  - Minor update to display of orbital elements target information
    to allow input boxes to stretch.

+++ July 2012 release

  - The validation button checks whether an epoch has been specified
    for targets with proper motion.

  - The prioritize button now opens a dialogue box offering to set/adjust
    priorities as well as the previous 'automatic' ordering.  (It also
    now supports survey containers and and and or folders.)

  - Imported a new version of the line catalogue (extra CN lines added).

  - Duplicate button added to survey containers.

  - Tried to stop coordinates being changed to J2000 when dragged in the
    position editor window.

  - Updates to validation: some messages should no longer be shown twice,
    it should now behave more consistently and it should no longer complain
    about the start date being before the current date.

+++ May 2012 release

  - SCUBA-2 pong map noise parameters are now interpolated between standard
    map sizes.

  - When loading a file of coordinates into a survey container, the
    remaining count and priority can now be specified after the
    position in tile.  (The position in tile can be given as -1 to skip
    this parameter.)

  - The Survey Container has been added.  This allows you to put multiple targets in
    the same container, and gives the Telescope Operator the choice if selecting n of
    the m targets.  It can either be placed at the top level of a Science Program
