 * This class is used to obtain the editor for SpItems.  Each program or plan

 * already exist, when a node of the corresponding science program type is
 * double-clicked or selected with the component editor already open.
 * <p>
 * Editors are stored in hashtables using the program or plan item as a key.
 * This avoids creating a new editor every time the user clicks on a node
 * in the program.  Each program or plan has to have its own editors though,
 * because more than one program can be open and editing the same type of
