 * It allows the OtAdvancedTreeDropTarget calss to check whether a node
 * is still being dragged over other nodes or over the background of the JTree
 * component. In the latter case the JTree is repainted to make the orange arrow
 * balls disappear.
 *
 * This seems to be the only way to implement such a functionality as
 * the DropTargetListener.dragOver method is not called while a node is
 * being dragged across the background of the JTree component (i.e. not
 * over other nodes). This means that the drag can't be rejected in the
 * usual way by calling the reject method on the drag event.
