JAC Observing Tool destructions.
--------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this you already have the code.

For the sake of completeness here are the full instructions.

0. Ensure suitable versions of Java and Ant are available.
   On EAO systems with a recent Ant but bad Java, this might require:
    setenv JAVA_HOME /local/java/jdk1.6
    setenv PATH $JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    rehash

1. Check out the code
    git clone https://github.com/eaobservatory/observing-tool.git jacot

2. change to the code directory ...
    cd jacot

3. Ant (ant.apache.org) is the preferred method of building ...
    ant
