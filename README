JAC Observing Tool destructions.
--------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this you already have the code.

For the sake of completeness here are the full instructions.

1a. if in Hilo ...
git clone /jac_sw/gitroot/ot.git ot

1b. if remote to the JAC ...
git clone ssh://ssh.jach.hawaii.edu/jac_sw/gitroot/ot.git ot

2. change to the code directory ...
cd ot

3. the OT is no longer built using gmake, instead there are two methods 
which can be used depending on circumstance. Ant ( ant.apache.org ) is 
the preferred method of building, however there is also a Perl script 
which can do the building. The Perl script should be phased out.

Either way, to build use one of the following ...

perl wiki-build.pl

... or ...

ant -f ant/build.xml

Building from the master branch requires Java 1.6 due to JSky3.
