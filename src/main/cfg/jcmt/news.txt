    the selected velocity frame.

  - Changed label for the queue box on the program panel.

+++ February 2022 release

  - Spurious warnings about the velocity frame for named planets and
    orbital elements have been removed.  (Topocentric will always
    be used with these coordinates.)

  - When logging in via Hedwig on Linux, xdg-open will be tried first
    as a method of opening your browser.  (The standard Java method
    does not appear to work reliably on Fedora 34 and 35.)

  - Tuning information for 'U'u has been updated.

  - Sideband-specific receiver temperature is plotted for 'U'u.

+++ July 2020 release

  - Observed counters in survey containers should now be processed
    correctly.  (Important only for containers using the "select" option.)

+++ May 2020 release 2

  - The OT is now available as a direct "jar" file download, because
    Java Web Start has been deprecated / removed in newer versions
    of Java.

  - There is now a built-in version check feature, which you can see on
    the start-up splash screen and also via the "Help -> About" menu option.

  - When interacting with the database, you can now log in via Hedwig.
    For example, to fetch a program, enter your project ID at the top of
    the dialog box as before, and then click the "Log in with Hedwig"
    button.  This should open your browser to allow you to log in.  Later
    in the same session, your OMP user ID should be remembered so you can
    simply click "Confirm" to proceed.  In the event of your session expiring,
    you will need to return to the "Browser log in" tab to log in again.

+++ May 2020 release 1

  - The OT should now connect to the OMP via HTTPS.

  - Some problems with more recent versions of Java have been addressed.

+++ March 2020 release

    warn, for example, if the pixels are non-square if the receiver
    is not HARP.

+++ January 2020 release

  - The validator now checks the receiver sideband mode.

+++ July 2019 release

  - "2SB" (sideband-separating) mode has been added for Namakanui.

  - The heterodyne frequency editor now allows IF frequencies to be
    entered numerically as well as by adjusting the scroll bars and
    the sideband used by each subsystem is highlighted.

  - The bandwidth selection on the heterodyne setup panel is now
    dynamically generated to allow for more bandwidth modes with
    Namakanui.  In the 3-spectral window case, additional modes
    are now offered in the 1st subsystem rather than the 3rd.

  - Validation of heterodyne setup sideband selections has been ameliorated.

  - It should now be possible to clear airmass and elevation constraints.

  - Time estimates for frequency-switched observations have been adjusted.

  - The validator now checks whether the distance to a position-switch
    reference position is extremely small.

  - The OT is now built as a single package.

+++ August 2018 release

  - Checking for proper motion values in the validator has been improved.

+++ May 2018 release

  - The ACSIS library has been updated.

  - The validator will now check site quality components: "min tau"
    should not be greated than "max tau".

  - The release notes should now open with the top (most recent)
    entry visible.

  - A preliminary adjustment to time estimates for frequency-switched
    observations has been made.

  - Some calculations performed by the heterodyne setup editor have
    been updated to take into account of redshift.  The sky frequency
    is now automatically recalculated when the program is saved in
    case the radial velocity of the target changed.

  - Double spaces have been removed from transition names in the
    heterodyne setup line catalog.  The OT should update existing
    names when loading a science program.

  - The proper motion panel should no longer be enabled for target
    types for which it is not appropriate.  The validator should now
    issue a warning if proper motion is specified for a coordinate
    system where it is not supported.

  - Coordinate values should no longer be lost when moving between
    target components containing orbital elements of different types.

+++ July 2017 release (2)

  - Adjusted some JAR files due to an issue with JDK 8u141.

+++ July 2017 release (1)

    for targets with proper motion.

+++ March 2017 release

  - Updated Horizons server URL.

  - Changed "RxA" special configurations to use RxA3m.

+++ February 2017 release

    heterodyne observations.

+++ July 2016 release

  - Added an example POL-2 MSB to the SCUBA-2 library.

+++ April 2016 release

  - Changed RxA3m IF frequency to 4 GHz.  Existing RxA3m heterodyne
    setup components should be recreated to use the new IF frequency.

  - Corrected name of H2CO 5 2 4 - 4 2 3 transition.  Existing heterodyne
    setup components using this transition should be updated as the old
    (incorrect) name will no longer be recognized.

+++ January 2016 release

  - Updated RxA3m receiver tuning information and made this the default
    instrument (in place of RxA3).  All RxA3 heterodyne setup components
    will need to be changed to take account of the new IF frequency used
    by RxA3m.  Note that the tuning range of RxA3m has been estimated as
    the same as that of RxA3.  The OT will be updated again once the exact
    tuning range of RxA3m is known.

  - Updated SCUBA-2 pong map parameters for sizes 2200-3000".  (This does
    not directly control the parameters used by the telescope but does
    improve the OT's time estimate for maps in this size range.)

  - Added the ability to specify allowed rotator (K-mirror) relative angles
    for HARP jiggle and stare observations.  You should only use this
    feature if you are sure your program requires it, otherwise the
    angles should be left all unselected (as they are by default).
    If you do restrict the angles, you may need to add a scheduling
    constraint in order to specify at which elevation your observation
    can be performed.

+++ December 2015 release

  - Rearranged observation panel so that HARP "Array Centred" option is
    not obscured by frequency switching parameters.

    change to the name of the transition in the line catalogue.

  - Set a default earliest schedule date in the past.

  - When loading Survey Container positions from files, handle
    REFERENCE positions in a similar manner to SCIENCE positions.

    editor's pop up menu.

+++ June 2013 release

  - Improved validation of DR Recipe components.

  - Increased FTS-2 variable mode resolution range.

+++ March 2013 release

  - Made RxA3 the default receiver again.  RxA3M is still present
    but should not be selected for now.

  - Issue a warning if changing to a narrower band receiver
    (e.g. RxA3M to RxA3) has put a spectral region out of range.
    When this happens the centre frequency of the band edge will
    be shown in the frequency configuration table, and the frequencies
    must be edited to create a useable tuning.

+++ February 2013 release

  - Added RxA3M as a new receiver.  RxA3 is still present in the
    OT to assist in converting programs to RxA3M, but it should
    not be selected for new programs.

+++ January 2013 release

  - Maximum memory usage increased to 1000M to avoid problems
    saving very large programs.

  - Updated line catalogue to include an SO2 line at 241GHz and
    H2CS line at 338GHz.

  - Upgraded JSky to version 3.

  - Included support for FTS-2 and POL-2.

    that we can use JSky3.  In this release the splash screen shows
    a warning if the Java version is older than this.

  - Two HDO lines at 225 and 241GHz added to the line catalogue.

  - Validator now checks for bare observations in survey containers.

    priorities as well as the previous 'automatic' ordering.  (It also
    now supports survey containers and and and or folders.)

  - Imported a new version of the line catalogue (extra CN lines added).

  - Duplicate button added to survey containers.

  - Tried to stop coordinates being changed to J2000 when dragged in the
    position editor window.

  - SCUBA-2 pong map noise parameters are now interpolated between standard
    map sizes.

  - When loading a file of coordinates into a survey container, the
