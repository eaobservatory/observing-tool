<h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<dl>
    <dt id="why">Why do I have to do this?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        A variety of reasons.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                The OMP project is providing a software system, of which the
                JCMT OT is a necessary component, to manage flexible scheduling at
                JCMT. Its purpose is to increase overall observing efficiency and
                facilitate communication with the PIs, and at the same time reduce the
                workload on our overworked queue managers and telescope operators.
                It will also allow
                you, the PI, to control your observing strategy in a fashion similar
                to that of classical scheduling. Note that the MSBs that you specify
                directly run the telescope and the data-acquisition during the
                observations.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>





    <dt id="length">What length should my MSB be?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        <b>Heterodyne:</b>
        The aspect of the MSB you most want to think about is its
        length. Let's say you have been allocated eight hours for a
        single source. Now, you could submit a single 8-hour MSB if you
        wanted. But that would be a very silly thing to do. For one thing, if
        your source is not up for more than eight hours, it would never be
        scheduled as our software would detect that it would set before the
        MSB could be completed. But even if your source were observable for 8
        hours solid, the observer won't chose to undertake it except near the
        very beginning of the night, which vastly decreases your scheduling
        opportunities.
        <p>

        <p>
        In the past calibrations have been charged to your project resulting
        in huge overheads for short observations. This is no longer the case.
        However if many short observations are all scheduled one after the
        other they would have to be sent to the queue one by one,
        thus driving the telescope operator and observer insane.
        </p>
        <p>
        If your sources are well separated across the sky a pointing
        may be required between them (even if they are only separated
        in time by ten minutes). However if they are close by each other
        they can be done consecutively. If you are including multiple sources
        in an MSB try to pair or group them so they are all are all
        close together. If this is not the case then include a
        note highlighting this to the operator.
        </p>
        <p>
        The golden mean? A 30&ndash;to&ndash;90 minute MSB.
        If you have any questions about the best way to distribute
        your sources please consult your Friend of Project for ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>SCUBA-2:</b>
        We have a 40 minute limit on SCUBA-2 observing blocks.
        See <a href="scuba2_example.html#notes_40min">here for details</a>.
        This upper limit usually concerns large pong maps while small daisies
        fall at the other end of the scale being potentially only a few minutes
        each. Having short MSBs for SCUBA-2 does not incur the same overheads
        as heterodyne. Like heterodyne observation consecutive sources that
        include a large slew will likely require a pointing between them,
        however SCUBA-2 has the additional factor or requiring the arrays
        to be set up again after a move between sources.

    <dt id="redundancy">My MSBs only last half an hour so it is
    a waste to do a calibration for each one!</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        Don't worry about this. The person doing the observing will have
        the choice of not doing calibrations that are highly redundant.
        <p>
    </dd>


    <dt id="qus_load">My project wont load when I enter my project number?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        If you have not previously stored anything to our database there will be
        nothing to retrieve,
        however space assigned for your project code is there for you when you create
        and first submit your MSBs.
        Create your project following the instructions above
        and store to the on-line database.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="qus_survey">I have a lot of sources &mdash; how can I speed up creation of my MSBs?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        If you have a large number of sources you may want to use the survey container;
        instructions on how to use this can be found
        <a href="advanced.html#survey">here</a>.
        Another option is to use the replication tool.
        This requires access to EAO machines and details can be found
        <a href="advanced.html#replication">here</a>.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="qus_submit">How do I submit my project?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        Ensure that you have filled out the title of your project correctly
        (Title, PI, Queue, Project ID),
        then go to 'Database' along the top menu
        and select 'Store to on-line database'.
        Once you have done this your friend of project will be able
        to access your MSBs and check them.
        For more details follow <a href="generic.html#database">this link</a>
        to the main OT primer page.
        </p>
    </dd>


    <dt id="library">I want to do something that is not in the library</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        You certainly can. However I suggest you let us know for two
        reasons. First, for your benefit, we'll be able to look your
        MSBs over to ensure that they will actually do what you intend.
        Secondly, for our benefit, we would like the chance to
        create a library MSB that matches your observing mode in case
        that will be useful to other users.
        </p>
    </dd>


    <dt id="server">What does this warning mean?
    "Some of the observations in the MSB contained
    default settings for the target information"</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        You probably forgot to enter your co-ordinates! If you really
        meant to observe 0:0:0, 0:0:0 just ignore it.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="timeest">I don't agree with the time estimates shown in the OT</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        We are fine-tuning these, but they will always be just that &mdash;
        estimates. However it doesn't really matter if they are a bit off. The
        estimates are used for three things. First, they are used by the QT to
        check whether the observation can be carried out before the source
        sets. Second, they allow the observer / telescope operator to plan the observing. For
        example, if they believe that the opacity is going to change in the next
        hour, they can select an MSB that is estimated to last less than an
        hour.
        </p>

        <p>
        Third, time estimates are used to provisionally debit remaining time
        during the night to keep a running tab on projects' use of their
        allocation. However the final time accounting is done the next day
        based on the actual time used by a project as derived from the data
        files and logs. If you find you still have time left after that you
        can submit an MSB to use it up.
        </p>

        <p>
        Please notify us if you believe the time estimate to be grossly in error.
