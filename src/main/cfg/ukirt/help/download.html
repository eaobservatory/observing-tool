<h2>Introduction.</h2>
</p>
<p>
The Observing Tool is a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a> based application for creating Science Programs in preparation for observing at <a href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/">JCMT</a> or <a href="http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu//">UKIRT</a>. While <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a> based operating systems are our lead platform, testing has been performed to varying degrees on <a href="http://opensolaris.org/">Solaris</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macos/">macOS</a>.<br/><br/>
As of May 2020 the Observing Tool for both telescopes is now distributed as a single JAR file.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Requirements.</h2>
</p>
<p>
To run the Observing Tool requires having a version of the <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava/">Java Runtime Environment</a> greater or equal to 1.8. If you are unsure wether or not you have Java installed and in your path, or which version of Java you have, open a console (Windows users can run a console by going to <code>'Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Command Prompt'</code>, macOS users can run a console by going to <code>'/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app'</code>, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> users <code>'Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Terminal'<code>, <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> users </code>'K Menu -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Terminal'</code>) and type the following :<br/>
</p>
<p>
<code>
$ java -version
</code>
</p>
<p>
Responses such as <code>"command not found"</code> indicate that either Java has not been installed or is not in your path.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It is recommended that you obtain the latest Java Runtime Environment from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle</a> or your operating system vendor.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Installation.</h2>
</p>
<p>
The Observing Tool is now available as a single JAR file which you can
simply download using the following link:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://ftp.eao.hawaii.edu/ot/jcmtot.jar">http://ftp.eao.hawaii.edu/ot/jcmtot.jar</a>
</p>
<p>
Your system may be set up to automatically run JAR files using Java.
If that is not the case, you can run the Observing Tool from a console
using the <tt>java -jar</tt> command:
</p>
<p>
<code>
$ java -jar jcmtot.jar
</code>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Upgrades.</h2>
</p>
<p>
When you open the Observing Tool, it will attempt to connect to the OMP
to determine the latest and current minimum versions.
The splash screen will initally show "Checking for updated version information..."
but after a few seconds this text should be replaced with a message indicating
whether your copy of the software is up to date.
If it is not, please download a new copy from the link above.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Additional.</h2>
</p>
<p>
Questions and bug reports should be emailed to
<a href="mailto:ukirtot@eao.hawaii.edu">ukirtot@eao.hawaii.edu</a>.<br/><br/>
Please note the operating system release and the Java version in your email as you will be asked.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Version-specific issues.</h2>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a> is known not to work. Oracle's Java is known to work.
</p>
<p>
The help pages do not appear to work correctly on macOS <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.4">Tiger</a> (10.4)<br/>
They are available online at <a href="http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu/ukirtot/">http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu/ukirtot/</a>
