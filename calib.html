<h1>Calibrations</h1>

<p>
The JCMT observing software needs further development to enable a more
flexible inclusion of calibration observations: presently there is no
easy way to add calibration observation MSBs.  The JCMT telescope
operators (TSS) will insert calibrations, pointings, foci, etc. into
the observing sequence as appropriate.  Without any specific
instructions in the science program calibrations will be carried out
by observing a 'standard' line in a suitable calibration source.
</p>

<p>
PIs are strongly advised to, at a minimum, add instructions and wishes
regarding calibrations in the <i>Calibration Note</i> to the TSS and
observers. A sample note has been included with the library templates.
For information on standard sources, lines, and observational setup, see:
<a href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/instrumentation/heterodyne/calibration/">
JCMT Heterodyne Standards</a>.
<em>Please be aware that the sub-mm positions for calibrators as used
at the JCMT may differ substantially from the the ones in archives
such as SIMBAD.</em>
</p>

<p>
There are several options for calibrations and ways to customize them:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
        No special calibration MSBs are provided in the Science Program:
        the calibrations will be carried out on a suitable calibration source
        selected by the TSS at a 'standard' frequency, possibly different from
        MSB tuning or redshift. For many applications, this is the most
        appropriate option.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
        A number of separate calibration MSBs on suitable targets are
        added to the science program, clearly identified as calibrations in
        their title. Typically the set of calibration MSBs should cover the
        RA-range of the science observations to ensure that at least one
        calibration MSB is available at any time.  PIs can customize the
        <i>Het setup</i> but need to take care to pick an appropriate
        switching-scheme for each calibrator chosen.  The TSS will insert the
        calibration MSBs into the observing queue as needed and per
        instruction in the science program.

                The ACSIS library has a set of special template MSBs for a
                position-switch, beam-switch, or scan calibration. The MSBs start
                with a series of (optional) pointing and focus observations. The
                calibration itself is a regular observation that has been marked as a
                calibration.  Configure the <i>Het setup</i> and
                <i>Target Component</i> to customize the calibration for your project.
                Typically choose either a position-switch, beam-switch,
                or scan calibration,
                depending on the selected calibration target (many of which require a
                position-switch).  Observational details for the calibrators can be
                found at this location:
                <a href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/instrumentation/heterodyne/calibration/">
                JCMT Heterodyne Standards</a>.  The calibration MSBs should be added
                to the science program with a high priority (low number) and high
                repeat counter to ensure that they will come up prominently and
                repeatedly in the JCMT Query Tool.

        Calibration observations are part of the science MSBs:

            <li>

                <p>
                Embed the calibration observation of a specific standard source
                and line in your science MSB by copying and pasting the desired
                components from the calibration template described above under
                option 2 (please read those instructions). The MSB should look like:
                </p>

<pre>
    -------------------------
    MSB
     ...

     Science Target

    -------------------------
</pre>

                <p>
                Please be aware of <i>inheritance</i>: in the example above you will need to
                add another <i>Target Component</i> inside Calibration Observations with the
                coordinates and offsets of the calibrator! Likewise, if the
                calibration needs to be done at a different frequency, another
                <i>Het setup</i> needs to be added inside the Calibration Observation. This will
                result in the appropriate re-tune between the calibrator and the
                science target. This should NOT be done for the manually tuned
                RxW. <b>WARNING:</b> If you include a calibration observation in this manner,
                both your target and calibration source must be observable before the
                MSB can be scheduled, which can severely restrict the night-time
                available to the project in case of an unfortunate combination of
                calibration and science targets.

<p>
Issues to consider regarding calibrations may be:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>How important is a precise calibration? For many projects it is
        sufficient to ensure that the telescope and receiver are within
        spec.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
        Can the calibration be done at a 'standard' frequency, possibly
        different from MSB tuning or redshift? Or should the calibration be
        done with the <i>Het setup</i> of the science observation and, if not
        close to a standard frequency, should a line-rich source be selected
        that will allow for the relative calibration of observations from
        night-to-night?
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
        Can the calibration be done using a different bandwidth than the
        science observation? Is an increase in bandwidth allowed to catch
        a nearby standard line? Increasing the bandwidth should not affect the
        calibration, except that the peak of very narrow lines will drop
        because of the lower resolution.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
        Is it important to observe a planet? Can this be done at one of
        the standard frequencies or should the <i>Het setup</i> from the
        science MSB be used?  Efficiencies derived from isolated observations
        of the continuum level of planets typically are not very
        accurate.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
