/**
 * Data that describes the insertion of a set of SpItems into or after another
 * SpItem. The client uses the <code>result</code> together with the
 * <code>referant</code> item to know where the insertion would take place.
 * For instance a result of INS_AFTER would mean that the <code>items</code>
 * would be inserted after the <code>referant</code> item in the program.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The SpInsertData is needed because new items are not always inserted
 * immediately inside or after the existing item where the insertion was
 * evaluated. For instance, when inserting an observation inside of an
 * observation folder, it must be placed <em>after</em> any existing
 * observation components.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    Observation Folder
 *       Site Quality (Observation Component)
 *   --&gt; where a new Observation would go if inserted inside of the folder
 * </pre>
