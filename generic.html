<h1>Creating your program</h1>

<p>
The JCMT OT software enables users to fully specify the observations required
to be carried out at the telescope for a specific program. In this section we
describe how to initially create a program, how to populate a program with MSBs
(for information about what an MSB is see <a href="intro.html#MSB">here</a>)
from a library provided, and how to save/upload your program to our database.
</p>

<h2 id="gs">Getting started</h2>


<p>
To begin you should initialize the JCMT OT. Remember that the software must
already be downloaded and installed for these pages to be
relevant (see our
<a href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/observing/software-installation/">software
installation page</a> &mdash; make sure you have downloaded the latest version!)
</p>


<p>
You will see two windows pop up. One has a color picture of the
telescope - that is the JCMT root window. You can use its menus to
open and save files, access the MSB libraries for both ACSIS and SCUBA-2,
and fetch programs from our database.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/root.png" width="281" height="248" class="figure" />
</p>

<p>
The window with the JCMT line drawing, which pops on top of the root
window, provides a shortcut to some of the most common start up
actions, so we call that the start up screen:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/startup.png" alt="Image of start up screen" class="figure" width="720" height="337">
</p>

<p>
For now, press "Create New Program" on the start up screen. The
start up window will be replaced by an science program window. If
you are using a proxy server to connect to the internet now would
be a good time to configure the OT to use this &mdash; see the
instructions <a href="advanced.html#proxy">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
("Open Existing Program" lets you open a science program that
you've previously edited and saved in your own computer system.  "Fetch
Program" allows you to download a program that that you have
completed and uploaded to our observing database.  To download
the program, of course, you will need the project
ID (e.g. m15ai77) and
<a href="http://omp.eao.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/issuepwd.pl">password</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="ysp">Your science program</h2>

<p>
Look at your blank science program window. It's essentially
divided in four sections:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The menu and general tool bars at the top
    <li>The program tool bar down the left side
    <li>The program panel in the middle
    <li>The editor panel on the right
</ol>

<p>
The bar between the program panel and the editor panel can be
dragged around to enlarge or reduce them.
</p>

<p>
When you start a new Science program the only information in the
program panel is a "Science Program"
line. Take the time to fill in its details in the Science Program
editor on the right. The most
important field here is the Project ID field. <em>You have to get this
right otherwise you will not be able to submit your program to
us</em>. Your project ID is what you were assigned when you submitted
your proposal for telescope time. It is of the form m15a followed by a
country letter and a two digit proposal number (sometimes followed by
a letter).
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/sciprog.png" alt="Science Program window" class="figure" width="828" height="692" />
</p>

<p>
Also on the panel are estimates of the total time the specified
program will take with and without optional observations,
which are currently both 0 since we haven't specified any
observations yet.
</p>



<h2 id="syp">Saving your progress</h2>

<p>
Now that we've done something we can save it. Open the File menu
in your Science Program window and choose "Save As...". You will be prompted
for a file name.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/filesave.png" alt="File Save menu" class="figure" width="500"  />
</p>


<p>
The file format is XML, which is a text (not binary) format that
you can read in later with the OT, or email to your
collaborators. If you have a question, you can also email your
file to your "Friend of the Project" along with your question.
</p>

<p>
You might have noticed that the title of your Science Program
was italics and now that you've saved the file, the title is
normal font. When you edit a component
of your Science Program its title changes font to indicate that
you need to save your work.
</p>


<h2 id="lib">The Libraries</h2>

<p>
The libraries containing commonly used MSBs can be found by by going to the JCMT
root window.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/root-menu.png" alt="The MSB library" width="281" height="248" class="figure" />
</p>

<h3 id="lib-acsis">The ACSIS Library</h3>

<p>By clicking on the ACSIS library in the JCMT root window a new window
will appear displaying a number of
folders containing commonly used ACSIS MSBs:
</p>

<p>
<img src="het_images/het_copy.png" alt="The ACSIS MSB library" class="figure" />
</p>

<p>
It is possible to open up and look inside the key ACSIS library components and
see inside the various types of MSBs by using the little switch
on the left of the folder icons. This is an open/close toggle switch.
In the image below these folders have been expanded:
</p>

<p>
<img src="het_images/het_library2.png" alt="The ACSIS MSB library" class="figure" />
</p>


<h3 id="lib-sc2">The SCUBA-2 Library</h3>

<p>By clicking on the SCUBA-2 library in the JCMT root window  new window
will appear displaying a number of
folders containing commonly used SCUBA-2 MSBs:
</p>

<p>
<img src="s2-images/SCUBA2_copy.png" alt="The SC2 MSB library" class="figure" />
</p>

It is possible to open up and look inside the key SCUBA-2 library components and
see inside the various types of MSBs by using the little switch
on the left of the folder icons. This is an open/close toggle switch.
In the image below these folders have been expanded:

<p>
<img src="s2-images/SCUBA2_library3.png" alt="The SC2 MSB library" class="figure" />
</p>



<h2 id="ele">Elements of a Science Program</h2>

<p>
The best way to get a feel for the various elements within an MSB and its
structure it is best to copy over an existing one from either the ACSIS
or SCUBA-2 library into a blank Science Program.Remember a Science program
will contain one or more MSBs - depending on the specific program of work.
</p>

<h3 id="exp-harp">Example of a basic MSB: a HARP stare</h3>

<p>
In order to produce this example I have copied over the HARP "Position
switch sample" from the ACSIS library into an empty Program.
</p>

<p>
To open up the MSB click on the push "lever". Inside you will find a
Note, a Site Quality Component, Het Setup component, a DR Recipe component,
a second Note (for calibrations), a Target Info. component, and an observation
component which is labeled "Science Observation". Inside the "Science
Observation" component we see a Sequence iterator, a Repeat iterator and
finally a stare:
<p>

<p>

</p>


<h3 id="exp-sc2">Example of a basic MSB: a SCUBA-2 Daisy</h3>

<p>
In order to produce this example I have copied over the "Point Source Daisy map"
from the SCUBA-2 library into an empty Program.
</p>

<p>
To open up the MSB click on the push "lever". Just as we saw in the ACSIS example
we find a Note, a Site Quality Component, Het Setup component, a DR Recipe component,
a Target Information component, and an observation component which is labeled
"Science Observation". Inside the "Science Observation" component we see a
Sequence iterator, and finally a stare:
</p>

</p>

<h2 id="thingies">Components, Iterators And All That</h2>


<p>
The various icons that appear when making your science program/MSB
are specific. The explanation for what these icons are are given below:
</p>
<ul class="custom_marker">
    <li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/icon_msb.png" alt="*" width="16" height="16" />
        MSBs are individually schedulable blocks and
        contain one or more fully specified science
        observation and any calibrations.

        <ul>
        <li>You should provide a unique name for the MSB - i.e.
         "CO (3-2) observation of M82"
        <li>You should specify the number of times you want the
         program to be Observed - by increasing the Observe counter.
         This is how you get to your total integration time.
        <li>You should edit the Priority
        <li>the OT will Provide the length of the current MSB as it stands</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/icon_observation.png" alt="*" width="16" height="16" />
        Observations are observations of a single astronomical
        target and contain components and a sequence.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/icon_component.png" alt="*" width="16" height="16" />
        Components are configurators for the JCMT systems such as
        the instrument (het setup component), the telescope (Target
        component) and the scheduler (Site Quality component).

 <ul>
    <li>Site Quality</li>
        <ul>
        <li>You should specify specific tau limits for an MSB with particular
        tau constrains</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
 <p>
 <ul>
    <li>DR Recipe</li>
        <ul>
        <li>You should select the most appropriate DR Recipe for an observation</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
 <p>
 <ul>
    <li>JCMT Instrument</li>
        <ul>
        <li>The precise component varies depending on if it is a continuum
        or heterodyne observation</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
 <p>
 <ul>
    <li>Target Information</li>
        <ul>
        <li>You should specify the target information here</li>
        <li>
            If required
            (i.e. for Heterodyne observations without a chop position)
            you should specify a reference position
        </li>
        </ul>
 </ul>
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/icon_iterator.png" alt="*" width="16" height="16" />
        Iterators are potentially multiple actions and
        contain other iterators and one or more
        eyes.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/icon_eye.png" alt="*" width="18" height="18" />
        Eyes are actions that results in the actual taking
        of data &mdash; a single data file per eye to be precise.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/icon_note.png" alt="*" width="18" height="18" />
        Notes are a repository of useful information and can
        go anywhere.
        <ul>
        <li>You should provide some details about your project - depth
        required/binning etc. This will help the observer and telescope
        operator understand your program.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="commoncomp">Common components</h2>


<p>
Simply by looking at the HARP and SCUBA-2 MSB examples provided
in the previous section it is possible to see several components
are common to both both Heterodyne and continuum MSBs,
but due to their differences they are expanded on within their own Chapters.
The two components that <i>are</i> identical are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
        Notes
        </p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <p>
        Site Quality
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3  id="note">Notes </h3>

<p>
the JCMT operates a flexible queue system. The best way to communicate
your program aims and completion parameters is to write a brief note
to accompany your MSB.
</p>

<p>
By default, the heterodyne library MSBs contain two note element at
the beginning of the MSB. The notes can be combined into a single one
if preferred:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
        A note for general remarks concerning the program.
        </p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <p>
        A calibration note for specific instructions for the calibration
        observations - if required.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
By default, the SCUBA-2 library MSBs contain a single note element at
the beginning of the MSB.
</p>

<p>
The note component consists of a text window where you can include
textual information, with the option of showing the note to the
observer and TSS at the time the observation is made. If you click on
the note icon, the right hand panel allows you to enter the name of
the note and the main text body of the note. The "Show to observer"
check-box should be checked if you want the note to be visible for the
observer/TSS at the time of observation.
<p>

</p>
It is <em>strongly</em>
advised that each of your MSBs contains at least one "Show to
observer" note. This should cover the aim of the project, what an
observer/Telescope Operator might want to keep an eye out for when
observing the program/MSB at the telescope - emission features,
baseline issues, noise levels.
</p>

<p>
<img src="het_images/het_note.png" alt="A note example" width="841" height="695" class="figure" />
</p>

<p>
Setting the "Show to observer" tick box brings up a "Completion
Parameter" and "binning" field. These should contain information which
help the observer and TSS to decide when to consider your observation
to be complete. By default, your program will be executed with exactly
the number of integration and number of repeats as specified. However,
where possible, an attempt will be made to optimize the process using
the specified Completion Parameters. The detailed logistics of the
scheduling may prevent this, but when possible this may save time for your
project or guarantee the results.
</p>

<p>
For instance you may want to
allow for more time than the MSBs nominally take to allow for the
addition of extra repeats in order to ensure the requested
RMS. Setting a S/N target may save unnecessary repeats, etc.
The "Completion Parameter" should include a value for the total
expired time, and/or a required signals-to-noise, and/or RMS noise
value. Best is to provide all three and whichever one is reached first
determines the completion. The assumed bin size, either in km/s or
MHz, should be entered in the "Binning" field. The above screen shot
shows an example of a possible "Show to observer" for an extragalactic
spectral line observation.  Be aware, however, that ultimately it is
up to <b>YOU</b>, the PI, to determine when the data have sufficient
S/N, by downloading and analyzing your data soon after they are
acquired and updating your MSBs as required.
</p>

<p>
Additional notes can be inserted at any point in the MSB from the icon
menu and you may have more than one "show to observer" notes in an
MSB. For example, you could choose to insert a "show to observer" note
above the "chop" element to clarify the use of an unusual chopping
scheme.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there is no need to repeat information in notes that is
already included in other components of the MSB. This might include
receiver tunings, chop throws, offset positions and science
targets. All of these should be set up in the appropriate MSB
components. If they are reproduced in notes, there is a risk that
changes made to main body of the MSB will not be reflected in the
notes, leading to conflicts between the notes and the MSB components
resulting in confusion at the telescope.
</p>



<h3 id="siteq">Site Quality</h3>

<p>
The Site Quality component specifies any weather-related scheduling
requirements for an MSB. Click on the Site Quality component to get
the Site Quality panel:
</p>

<p>
<img src="het_images/het_site_quality.png" alt="Site Quality Component" width="848" height="692" class="figure" />
</p>

<p>
The Time Allocation Committee (TAC) normally allocates your program a certain
range of tau (opacity), so you probably don't need to change anything here
unless your program is using multiple receivers and the TAC-allocated tau
range is not sufficiently specific for this MSB. You should specify an
appropriate range of tau to match the demands of the receiver to be
used. But <b>beware</b>: the resulting range of tau in which
the MSB can be observed is then the intersect of the TAC allocation
and your input: make sure this is not an empty set! For example, if
the TAC allocation for your project is weather band 4 (tau(225GHz)
between 0.12 and 0.2) and you request a tau range between 0.1 and
0.12, then your project will be picked up for observation ONLY if the
tau is EXACTLY 0.12.
</p>

<p>
The default value of the sub-millimeter seeing is "Don't Care".
</p>

<p>
It is useful to set the "&tau; for noise calculation" value, however,
to the <i>average</i> or <i>expected</i> value of tau during which
your observations are expected to be obtained.  (Note that the OT
<i>does not know</i> what &tau; range was allocated for your project.)
The OT uses the value in this field to calculate the estimated RMS of
the observation specified in the phot/sam etc. "eye"-cons.
</p>

<a href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/observing/weather-bands/">
JCMT's weather pages</a>.
</p>





<h2 id="check">Checklist</h2>
<p>When creating your own program you should ensure you:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Fill in your Science Program details</p></li>
    <li><p>Fetch a template MSB from the library</p></li>
    <li><p>Set the target co-ordinates</p></li>
    <li><p>Select the DR recipe</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
And also where necessary:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Increase the number of "observations" required and scan time if necessary for the MSBs</p></li>
    <li><p>Modify the chop/update an off/reference position</p></li>
    <li><p>Select the instrument set up</p></li>
    <li><p>Make an informative note for the observer</p></li>
    <li><p>Specify site quality - typically this can be left as "allocated"</p></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
<p>
When you think you are happy with your MSB, your are
<strong>strongly</strong> advised to validate the MSB before
submitting it to the database.
To do this, click on your science program and press the "Validation"
button on the bar above. This will tell you if there's anything
seriously wrong with your MSBs &mdash; the output can be a bit cryptic
though &mdash; so do contact your Friend of Project if you can't figure
out what it means. You can also check individual MSBs and observations.
Check the validation messages and contact your Friend of the Project if
you need help.
</p>



<h2 id="database">Submitting to our database</h2>

<p>
When you are happy about the MSBs you have created you can submit
them to our database. As soon as you do this, they may be observed
so don't do this unless you mean it! To submit your program to our
database, pull down the Database menu on your Science Program window:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/submit.png" alt="Submitting" width="603"  class="figure" />
</p>




<p>
A little window will pop up using the Project ID that you put
into your Science Program at the start
(see <a href="#ysp">Your science program</a>).
It will also ask you for a password.

<p>
<img src="images/submit_window.png" alt="Submitting" width="300"  class="figure" />
</p>


You can get a password from our password generator at
<a href="http://omp.eao.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/issuepwd.pl">
http://omp.eao.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/issuepwd.pl </a>. If you
forget it, go there to get another one. If you are PI on more
than one project you'll need a password per project so that you
can share it with your different sets of Co-Is. The password you
get will also allow you access to your
<a href="http://omp.eao.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/feedback.pl">Feedback Area</a>
to check on the progress of your project, double-check
your MSBs, retrieve your data and exchange views with our
staff. Check it out. Both the above links can also be found off
on OMP home page
<a href="http://omp.eao.hawaii.edu/">http://omp.eao.hawaii.edu</a>
</p>

<p>
When you do get your password and submit your program, you will
receive a summary of all the MSBs contained in your
program. Check to make sure that everything is okay. If the
are major problems with you science program the database may complain
and refuse to accept the submission. If you don't understand what
the problem is, email us along with a copy of the problematic
project, but check the
<a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions </a> for hints first.
</p>

<p>
One last thing: don't forget to save your Science Program to
your local file too. But &mdash; always start a new session by
fetching the program from our database before making any
changes, since our system modifies your science program to
indicate which observations have been observed.
</p>



<h3>Integration times</h3>

<p>
Note that throughout this document <b>integration times</b> are the
<em>"on"-source</em> time only, instead of <em>"on+off"</em> as
before.

<h3>Advanced OT Topics</h3>

<p>
There is a section on
<a href="advanced.html#advanced">Advanced Topics</a>
that observers should read. There you will learn more about
how the Target and Heterodyne components can interact with each other,
and also how to use the
<a href="advanced.html#andor">AND/OR folders</a>
when you have many MSBs in your program.
<a href="advanced.html#survey">Survey containers</a> may significantly
